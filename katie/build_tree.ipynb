      "The modern Labrador's ancestors originated on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the [[St. John's water dog]], a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with [[Rafeiro do Alentejo|mastiffs]] brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab [[Mixed-breed dogs|mixes]], and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.\n",

      "*'''Coat''': The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.<ref name=\"akc.org\"/>\n",
      "*'''Head''': The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.\n",
      "*'''Jaws''': The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.\n",

A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. [[DNA testing]] can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" />\n",

      "The intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur colouring.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\"/> Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called \"snow nose\" or \"winter nose\"). This is due to a reduction in the [[enzyme]] [[tyrosinase]] which indirectly controls the production of [[melanin]], a dark colouring. Tyrosinase is temperature dependent—hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather—and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" />\n",

Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or \"flesh coloured\" in addition to having the same colour around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation.<ref name=\"pslra\" /><ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" /> A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC's current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh coloured rims around the eyes.

      "Breeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes.

[[Osteoarthritis]] is very uncommon in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding.

The founding breed of the Labrador was the [[St. John\\'s water dog]], a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John\\'s Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John\\'s Dog breeding with [[Rafeiro do Alentejo|mastiffs]] brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John\\'s Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John\\'s Dog often appear in modern Lab [[Mixed-breed dogs|mixes]], and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.\\n\\n==Early descriptions==\\n[[File:Buccleuch Avon (1885).png|thumb|[[Buccleuch Avon]] (b. 1885), a foundational dog of many modern Labrador lineages.]]\\n\\nSeveral early descriptions of the St. John\\'s water dog exist. In 1822, explorer [[William Cormack|W.E. Cormack]] crossed the island of Newfoundland by foot. In his journal he wrote \"The dogs are admirably trained as retrievers in fowling, and are otherwise useful.....The smooth or short haired dog is preferred because in frosty weather the long haired kind become encumbered with ice on coming out of the water.\"<ref name=\"great dane\">{{cite web\\n| title=Labrador Retriever History\\n| publisher=\\'\\'grandane.com\\'\\' Guide to Nova Scotia Kennels\\n| year=2007\\n| url=http://www.grandane.com/NS.Kennels/Labhistory.html\\n| accessdate=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\\n\\nAn early report by a Colonel Hawker described the dog as \"by far the best for any kind of shooting. He is generally black and no bigger than a Pointer, very fine in legs, with short, smooth hair and does not carry his tail so much curled as the other; is extremely quick, running, swimming and fighting....and their sense of smell is hardly to be credited....\"<ref name=\"great dane\"/>\\n\\nThe first St. John\\'s dog was said to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed\\'s reputation had already spread to England; there is a story that the [[James Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury|2nd Earl of Malmesbury]] saw a St. John\\'s dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.<ref name=\"Tfh\">{{cite web\\n  | last = Burrows\\n  | first =Richard T.\\n  | title =The Guide to Owning a Labrador Retriever.\\n  | publisher = T.F.H.

The animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth.\" wrote Jukes. \"These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to \"toil\" or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind.\"\\n\\n==Name==\\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\\nThe foundational breed of what is now the Labrador Retriever was known as the St. John\\'s water dog, St. John\\'s dog, or Lesser Newfoundland. When the dogs were later brought to England, they were named after the geographic area known as \"the Labrador\" (they were known as Labrador Retrievers because they \"retrieved\" in the Labrador Sea) or simply Labrador to distinguish them from the larger Newfoundland breed, even though the breed was from the more southern [[Avalon Peninsula]].\\n\\nThe [[progenitor]]s of the Labrador retriever were actually from [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] exceptionally, the breed known as the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]] was created near the same time in Labrador. The two breeds\\' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog we see and know today, and the dog from Newfoundland became the Labrador.\\n\\n==Historical landmarks==\\n\\nThe first written reference to the breed was in 1814 (\"Instructions to Young Sportsmen\" by Colonel [[Peter Hawker]]),<ref name=\"allLabradors.com_history\"/> the first painting in 1823 (\"Cora.

The shade was known as \"Golden\" until required to be changed by the UK Kennel Club, on the grounds that \"Gold\" was not actually a colour. Over the 20th century a preference for far lighter shades of yellow through to cream prevailed, until today most yellow Labradors are of this shade.

However, the shade was not seen as a distinct colour until the 20th century; before then, according to Vanderwyk, such dogs can be traced but were not registered. A degree of [[crossbreed]]ing with [[Flatcoated retriever|Flatcoat]] or [[Chesapeake Bay retriever]]s was also documented in the early 20th century, prior to recognition. Chocolate Labradors were also well established in the early 20th century at the kennels of the Earl of Feversham, and Lady Ward of Chiltonfoliat.<ref name=\"Vanderwyk\">{{cite web | last =Vanderwyk\\n  | first =Jack\\n  | title =Origins of Chocolate Labradors\\n  | url =http://www.labradornet.com/chochistory.html\\n  | accessdate = February 14, 2011 }}</ref>\\n\\nThe bloodlines as traced by Vanderwyk each lead back to three black Labradors in the 1880s—Buccleuch Avon (m), and his sire and dam, Malmesbury Tramp (m), and Malmesbury June (f).

In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within [[American Kennel Club]] standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children.\\n\\nThe breed tends to [[Moult|shed]] hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in [[temperate climate]]s.<ref name=\"pslra\"/> Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary.<ref name=\"animalforum\">\"[http://www.animalforum.com/dbreed/splabrador.htm Sporting breeds: Labrador Retriever].\" \\'\\'[http://www.animalforum.com/ animalforum.com].\\'\\' (c) 1998–2007. Retrieved on September 17, 2007.</ref> Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. The [[webbed toes]] of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a \"snowshoe\" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes—a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.\\n\\n====Official breed standards====\\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors.

It is possible for [[recessive]] genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected [[pigmentation]] effects to different parts of the body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown (\"liver\", caused by having two genes for chocolate),<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\">{{cite web\\n  | last =Wagner\\n  | first =Sharon\\n  |author2=Laura Michaels\\n   | title =Pigment in Yellow Labradors\\n  | url =http://www.woodhavenLabradors.com/yellow-pigment.html\\n  | accessdate = September 13, 2007 }}</ref> or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. [[DNA testing]] can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" />\\n\\nThe intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur colouring.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\"/> Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called \"snow nose\" or \"winter nose\"). This is due to a reduction in the [[enzyme]] [[tyrosinase]] which indirectly controls the production of [[melanin]], a dark colouring. Tyrosinase is temperature dependent—hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather—and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" />\\n\\nA colouration known as \"Dudley\" is also possible. Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or \"flesh coloured\" in addition to having the same colour around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation.<ref name=\"pslra\" /><ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" /> A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC\\'s current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh coloured rims around the eyes. True Dudleys are extremely rare.<ref name=\"woodhaven_pigmentation\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/labrador/labarticle6.htm |title=Labrador Retriever Breed Standards Comparison Chart |publisher=Canada\\'s Guide to Dogs Website |date=March 14, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232820/http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/labrador/labarticle6.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df= }}</ref>\\nBreeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.\\n\\n====Show and field lines====\\n[[File:American and English Labrador heads.jpg|thumb|left|Head and [[Snout|muzzle]] appearance: field (left), and show (right), showing the shorter muzzle length, more solid appearance head, and \"pronounced\" stop of the latter.]]\\nAs a result of specialised breeding there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors.
