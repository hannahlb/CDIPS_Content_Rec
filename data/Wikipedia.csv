[[Image:Dog kennel Mason.jpg|thumb|A dog sits in front of a typical kennel panel]]
A '''kennel''' is a structure or shelter for [[dog]]s or [[cat]]s. Used in the plural, ''the kennels'', the term means any building, collection of buildings or a property in which dogs or cats are housed, maintained, and (though not in all cases) bred. A kennel can be made out of various materials, the most popular being wood and canvas. 

==Breeding kennels==
This is a formal establishment for the propagation of animals, whether or not they are actually housed in a separate shed, the garage, a state-of-the-art facility, or the family dwelling. Licensed breeding kennels are heavily regulated and must follow relevant government legislation. [[Breed club (dog)|Breed club]] members are expected to comply with general Code of Ethics and guidelines applicable to the breed concerned. [[Kennel club|Kennel council]]'s may also stipulate criteria to be met before issuing registration papers for puppies bred. A ''kennel name'' or ''kennel prefix'' is a name associated with each breeding kennel: it is the first part of the [[breed registry#Registered names|registered name]] of a pedigreed dog which was bred there. Likewise, a [[cat registry]] is an organization that registers cats for exhibition and breeding purposes. A cat registry is not the same as a cat club or breed society (these may be affiliated with one or more registries with whom they have lodged breed standards in order to be able to exhibit under the auspices of that registry).

==Boarding kennels==
This is a place where dogs or cats are housed temporarily for a fee, an alternative to using a [[pet sitter]].  Although many people worry about the stress placed on the animal by being put in an unfamiliar and most likely crowded environment, the majority of boarding kennels work to reduce stress.{{cn|date=August 2014}} Many kennels offer one-on-one ""play times"" in order to get the animal out of the kennel environment.  Familiar objects, such as blankets and toys from home, are also permitted at many kennels.  Similarly, many kennels nowadays also offer grooming and training services in addition to boarding, with the idea being that the kennel can be the owner's ""one-stop shop"" for all three services.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

In the United States the term boarding kennel is also used to refer to [[cattery|boarding catteries]] and licensing agencies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.co.snohomish.wa.us/Departments/Auditor/Divisions/Licensing/Pet/KennelLicenseTypes.htm|title=Snohomish County, WA - Official Website - Official Website|work=snohomish.wa.us}}</ref> do not always differentiate between commercial boarding kennels for dogs and other animal or cat boarding kennels. It is estimated that in 2008 people in the US will spend $3.29 billion on boarding and grooming services. In 2007 actual market surveys showed that $3.0 billion was spent on these services. Annual kennel boarding expenses for dog owners was $225, and for cat owners was $149 according to a 2007-2008 survey.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.appma.org/press_industrytrends.asp | title= Industry Statistics & Trends | publisher=American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, Inc | accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref>

|quote= Gruenewald was a ""cynologist"" (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics)
}}</ref><ref>Five quotes are used in the Wiktionary to justify inclusion of the word cynology/cynologist.
*''1892, The Journal of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary Archives, 'Professor Mills has done excellent work in his course on ""Cynology, the Dog and his Diseases,"" a subject hitherto only taught incidentally in any college ...'''
*''1948, Dogs In Britain Clifford L.B. Hubbard, MacMillan & Co, 'Buffon's table is here reproduced as it was a sincere attempt towards laying a foundation upon which cynologists might work out the origin of breeds and their varieties and the analysis of dog groups.'''
*''1951, The American Mercury, 'Students of cynology can trace in the dictionary the dog's remarkable rise in the public esteem in this century.'''
*''1985, The Complete Dog Book, published by the American Kennel Club, 'The annals of cynology make no further mention of the breed until 1901 when a combined Rottweiler and Leonberger Club was formed.'''
*''1990, Austin Farrer, in his introduction to G. W. Leibniz’ ""Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil""; quoted in Charles Taliaferro’s 2005 Evidence and Faith ([http://www.bored.com/ebooks/Religion/about%20religion%20and%20ethics/theodicy.html online]) 'Now neither probatology nor cynology could hope to be universal — the world is not all sheep nor all dog: it would have to be hylology;'</ref>

== Cynology ==
Cynology is a classical compound word (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κύων}}, ''kyōn'', [[genitive]] {{lang|grc|κυνός}}, ''kynos'', ""dog""; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') referring to the study of [[dog]]s.  The word is not found in major English dictionaries and it is not a recognized scientific discipline in English-speaking countries.
Similar words are found in other languages, such German and Dutch ''kynologie'', and the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''кинология'', from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|''*ḱwon-''}}, which is the source of ''hound''.

κυν is also the source of the English word ''cynic'', and is directly related to ''canine'' and ''hound''.

== Usage in English ==
The suffix '-logy' in [[English language|English]] words refers to a study, or an academic discipline, or field of scientific study.  English Classical compound words of this type may confer an impression of scientific rigor on a non-scientific occupation or profession.

Usage in English of the word cynology is rare, and occasionally found in the names of dog training academies, with cynologist sometimes being used as a title by some dog trainers or handlers. People who informally study the dog may refer to themselves as 'cynologists' to imply serious study or scientific work.

== The study of dogs ==
Studies of dogs, and dog related matters, are carried out and published: in general, by those who have mastered the relevant literature or aspects of it, and the formal structure of the subject (National and International Kennel Club breeding, health, and show regulations etc.); in specific, by [[biologist]]s, [[geneticist]]s, [[zoologist]]s, [[ethology|behaviourist]]s, and others [[Science|scientist]]s, historians, veterinarians and breed specialists.

Informally, dogs may be studied by those with no specific scientific training, such as publicists and authors, [[Dog breeding|breeders]], [[Dog trainer|trainers]], [[Police dog|police dog handlers]], [[Pet Psychic|animal communicators]] and others, through literature, history,and personal experience. Many useful books and videotapes for the public have been produced through informal study of the dog.
Those who, very rarely, refer to themselves as ""cynologists"", may formally or informally study such things as veterinary science, dog breeding, [[Dog breed|breed]] development, dog [[Dog behavior|behavior]] and training, and the literature and history of dogs.

== Usage in other languages ==
Cynology may have other connotations or uses in languages other than English, see German [[:de:Kynologie|Kynologie]], Dutch [[:nl:Kynologie|Kynologie]] and Czech [[:cs:Sportovní kynologie|Sportovní kynologie]].

The very rare term ''cynologist'' in English, is generally found to refer to ""canine specialists"" such as; certified care professionals, certified show judges, breeders, breed enthusiasts, certified dog-trainers and [[Professional handler|professional dog-handlers]].

==Pack behavior in specific species==
[[African wild dogs]] (''Lycaon pictus'') [[African wild dog#Social structure|live and hunt in packs]]. Males assist in raising the pups, and remain with their pack for life, while the females leave their birth pack at about the age of two and a half years old to join a pack with no females. Males outnumber the females in a pack, and usually only one female breeds with all of the males. African wild dogs are not [[territory (animal)|territorial]], and they hunt cooperatively in their packs, running down large game and tearing it apart. They cooperate in caring for wounded and sick pack members as well as the young.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Lycaon_pictus.html|title= Lycaon pictus: Information|accessdate= 21 April 2008|author= Animal Diversity Web|publisher= University of Michigan}}</ref>

[[New Guinea singing dog]] (''Canis lupus dingo''): In 1994, studies were done in Oregon on a captive social group of New Guinea singing dogs. Physical attacks between same-sex adults when females were in estrus led to them being kept in pairs; attacks were only between equals and inferiors in the pack hierarchy, never on higher ranking individuals. Pairs would tolerate their offspring through one or two breeding seasons. When kept together, they exhibited distinctive behaviours. They do not use the ""play bow"" common among other canids. Food is shared equally, not fought over, and all adults and adolescents regurgitate food for the young. They engage in choral howling, but without dominance behaviour that has been seen in wolf and coyote pack howling.<ref>

==Dominance and the alpha wolf==
Dominance is an ubiquitous phenomenon in social animals. Animals which typically predominate over others are associated with the term ''alpha''. Among pack-living wolves, alpha wolves are the genetic parents of most cubs in the pack. Such access to mating females creates strong selective pressure for intra-sex competition.

Wolves show deference to the alpha pair in their pack by allowing them to be the first to eat and, usually, the only pair to reproduce. Wolves use [[eye contact]] as an indicator of dominance or submission, but in order to establish a dominant position they often also show physical superiority through playing or fighting. The smaller and more nuclear a pack is, the status of alpha is less likely to be obtained through fighting, and young wolves instead leave the pack to find a mate and produce offspring of their own.<ref>Mech, L. David. 1999.</ref> Larger or less-nuclear packs may operate differently and possess more complex and flexible social structures.<ref>Dutcher, Jim and Jamie. ''Wolves At Our Door'', Simon and Schuster, 2002</ref>{{Better source|date=November 2013}}

In the case of other wild canids, the alpha male may not have exclusive access to the alpha female;<ref>Gary Greenberg and Maury M. Haraway. 1998</ref> moreover, other pack members may guard the [[maternity den]] used by the alpha female; as with the [[African wild dog]], ''Lycaon pictus''.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009</ref>

As dominant roles may be deemed normal among social species with extended parenting, it has been suggested that the additional term ''alpha'' is not required merely to describe dominance due to its ubiquity, but should be reserved for where they are the predominant pack progenitor. For instance, wolf biologist [[L. David Mech]] stated <blockquote>""calling a wolf an ''alpha'' is usually no more appropriate than referring to a human parent or a doe deer as an ''alpha''. Any parent is dominant to its young offspring, so ''alpha'' adds no information. Why not refer to an alpha female as the ''female parent'', the ''breeding female'', the ''matriarch'', or simply the ''mother''? Such a designation emphasizes not the animal's dominant status, which is trivial information, but its role as pack progenitor, which is critical information. The one use we may still want to reserve for ''alpha'' is in the relatively few large wolf packs {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} multiple litters. ... In such cases the older breeders are probably dominant to the younger breeders and perhaps can more appropriately be called the ''alphas''. ... The point here is not so much the terminology but what the terminology falsely implies: a rigid, force-based dominance hierarchy.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/alstat/alpst.htm|title= Alpha Status, Dominance, and Division of Labor in Wolf Packs|accessdate= 21 April 2008|author= Mech, L.

=== Use in dog training ===
One of the most persistent theories in dog training literature is the idea of the ''[[alpha (ethology)|alpha wolf]]'', an individual gray wolf who uses body language and, when needed, physical force to maintain its dominance within the wolf pack. The idea was first reported in early wolf research .{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It was subsequently adopted by dog trainers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clickersolutions.com/articles/2001/dominance.htm |title=ClickerSolutions Training Articles - The History and Misconceptions of Dominance Theory |publisher=Clickersolutions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> The term ''alpha'' was popularized as early as 1976 in the dog training book ''How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend'' (Monks of New Skete), which introduced the idea of the ''[[alpha roll]]'', a technique for punishing unwanted dog behaviours. Psychologist and dog trainer [[Stanley Coren]] in the 2001 book ''How to Speak Dog'' says ""you are the alpha dog...You must communicate that you are the pack leader and dominant"".<ref>{{cite book|last= Coren|first= Stanley|title= How to Speak Dog|edition= First Fireside|year= 2001|publisher= Simon & Schuster|isbn= 0-684-86534-3|chapter=20|quote=|page= 250 }}</ref>

Training techniques assumed to be wolf pack related such as scruff shaking, the alpha roll and recommendations to be alpha to your dog continue to be used and recommended by some dog training instructors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bordercollie.org/boards/lofiversion/index.php/t8605.html |title=BC Boards |publisher=Bordercollie.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> It has been suggested that the use of such techniques may have more to do with human psychology than with dog behaviour; ""dominance hierarchies and dominance disputes and testing are a fundamental characteristic of all social groups... But perhaps only we humans learn to use punishment primarily to gain for ourselves the reward of being dominant.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pryor|first= Karen|title= Don't Shoot the Dog!|edition= Bantam trade paperback|date=August 1999|publisher= Bantam Books|location=|language=|isbn= 0-553-38039-7|chapter=4|quote=|page= 108}}</ref>
Many contemporary trainers would agree, advocating the use of rewards to teach commands and encourage good communication between owners and their pets. Some canine behaviourists  suggest that kind, efficient training uses games to teach commands which can be utilised to benefit the owner's everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://affinitydogtraining.co.uk/how-to-understand-your-dog-now-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-pack-leader/ |title=Dog behaviour pack leaders debunked |publisher=Affinity Dog Training |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>

== Recognition of rare breeds ==
Breeds go through a recognition process by breed clubs, kennel clubs and other agencies, so that dogs can be guaranteed through written documentation to be a [[Purebred (dog)|member of a specific breed]]. For example, the Canadian department of agriculture, [[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada]], has strict requirements for the registering of new breeds, which are referred to as ""emerging breeds.""<ref>[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/A-11.2//20080815/en?command=home&caller=SI&fragment=Animal%20Pedigree&search_type=all&day=15&month=8&year=2008&search_domain=cs&showall=L&statuteyear=all&lengthannual=50&length=50 Animal Pedigree Act] ""evolving breed"" (race en voie de constitution) means a group of animals in the process of evolving into a new breed.</ref> In the past, this process was limited to each country's national governing body for dog breeds (two in the case of the United States), and gaining recognition for a new breed was a closely checked, long process. With the advent of the internet a vast number of minor registries has proliferated, allowing clubs, breeders, and internet entrepreneurs to create their own registries for their own purposes.<ref>{{cite web

'''Dogs''' (''Canis lupus familiaris''), known in [[Classical Chinese]] as ''quan'' ({{zh|c=犬|p=quǎn|w=''ch'üan''}}), played an important role in ancient Chinese society.

== Domestication ==

An examination of the genetic evidence by Carles Vila and others confirms that the progenitor of the domestic dog is the wolf (''Canis lupus'').<ref>J. A. Leonard, R. K. Wayne, J. Wheeler, R. Valadez, S. Guillén, C Vilà, (2002) ""Ancient DNA evidence for Old World origin of New World dogs"" ''Science'' 298: 1613-1616.</ref> The suggested date of their domestication is about 100,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]. While accepting the wolf as the ancestor, paleontologists and archaeologists believe domestication came much later. A reconstruction by a joint team of researchers from China and Sweden postulates that humans may have domesticated dogs from wolves as recently as 15,000 years ago. They found that, while most dogs share a common gene pool, genetic diversity is highest in East Asia, suggesting dogs have been domesticated there the longest. Genetic research suggests that all domestic dogs worldwide may have originated from possibly three female [[wolf|wolves]].

The dog, along with the pig, were the earliest animals domesticated in China. Remains of both animals have been found in the oldest [[Neolithic]] settlements of the [[Yangshao]] (circa 4000 BC) and [[Hemudu]] (circa 5000 BC) cultures. Canine remains similar to the [[Dingo]] have been found in some early graves excavated in northern China. 

Tests on neolithic dog bones show similarities between dogs from this era and modern-day Japanese dogs, especially the [[shiba inu]].<ref>Nobuo Shigehara, Qi Guoqin, Hajime Komiya, Yuan Jing, ""Morphological study of the ancient dogs from three neolithic sites in China"" ''International Journal of Osteoarchaeology'' Vol. 8 Issue 1 (2008) pp. 11-22.</ref>

== Dogs as ceremonial sacrifice ==

According to Bruno Schindler, the origin of using dogs as sacrificial animals dates back to a primitive cult in honour of a dog-shaped god of vegetation whose worship later became amalgamated with that of [[Shang Di]], the reigning deity of the Shang [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].

Systematic excavation of Shang tombs around Anyang since 1928 have revealed a large number of animal and human [[sacrifices]]. There was hardly a tomb or a building consecrated without the sacrifice of a dog. At one site, Xiaotong, the bones of a total of 825 human victims, 15 horses, 10 oxen, 18 sheep and 35 dogs were unearthed. Dogs were usually buried wrapped in reed mats and sometimes in [[lacquer]] [[coffin]]s. Small bells with clappers, called ''ling'' (鈴) have sometimes been found attached to the necks of dogs or horses. The fact that alone among domestic animals dogs and horses were buried demonstrates the importance of these two animals to ancient Chinese society. It's reflected in an [[idiom]] passed down to modern times: ""to serve like a dog or a horse."" (犬馬之勞).

Shang oracle bones mention questions concerning the whereabouts of lost dogs. They also refer to the ''ning'' (寧) rite during which a dog was dismembered to placate the four winds or honour the four directions. This sacrifice was carried over into Zhou times. The ''Er ya'' records a custom to dismember a dog to ""bring the four winds to a halt."" (止風). Other ceremonies involving dogs are mentioned in the ''Zhou li''. In the ''nan'' (難) sacrifice to drive away pestilience, a dog was dismembered and his remains buried in front of the main gates of the [[Capital (political)|capital]]. The ''ba'' (軷) sacrifice to ward off evil required the [[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]], riding in a jade chariot, to crush a dog under the wheels of his carriage. The character ''ba'' gives a clue as to how the ceremony took place. It is written with the radical for chariot (車) and a phonetic element which originally meant an animal whose legs had been bound (发). It was the duty of a specially appointed official to supply a dog of one colour and without blemishes for the sacrifice. The [[blood]] of dogs was used for the swearing of covenants between nobles. 

Towards the late fifth century BC, surrogates began to be used for sacrifice in lieu of real dogs. The ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' mentions the use of [[straw dog]]s as a metaphor:
<poem>
     Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;
     the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.<ref>In Chinese: 天地不仁 以萬物為芻狗 聖人不仁 以百姓為芻狗. Chen Guying ed. ''Laozi zhu yi ji ping jie'' 老子注譯及評介 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1984) at 78. Incidentally the term ""straw dogs"" became the title of a book of philosophy by [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (''[[Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals]]'') and a [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|1971 film]].</ref>
</poem>

However, the practice of burying actual dogs by no means died out. One [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] royal mausoleum, for example, included two hunting dogs with gold and silver neck rings. 

Later, clay figurines of dogs were buried in tombs. Large quantities of these sculptures have been unearthed from the [[Han dynasty]] onwards. Most show sickle-shaped tails not unlike the modern [[shiba inu]] or [[akita inu]].

== Dogs as food ==

Dogs, along with pigs, constituted the major source of animal [[protein]] in ancient China{{facts|date=October 2011}}. ""Dog butchers"" (狗屠) was a specific (and lowly-regarded) profession. They are called ""idle and untrustworthy"" by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]]. Dog butchers who rose to prominence include the strongman [[Zhu Hai]], the musician [[Gao Jianli]], and general [[Fan Kuai]] (all circa third century BC). 

The ancient word for [[dog meat]] was ''ran'' (肰). Indeed, it was so common that the [[Old Chinese]] character meaning ""to burn"" or ""to roast"" showed dog meat on top of a fire (然).

The ''Zhou Li'' divides dogs into three categories: the ''tianquan'' (田犬) or watchdog, the ''feiquan'' (吠犬) or barking dog, and the ''shi-quan'' (食犬) or edible dog. With the exception of the liver every part of the animal was considered edible. 

At the banquests of feudal lords a dish of dog's broth and glutinous rice was considered a great delicacy. For summer, dried fish fried in pungent dog's fat was thought to be cooling. When dog's meat was prepared as sacrificial meat it had first to be marinated in vinegar and pepper.

== Dogs for hunting ==

Dogs were associated with hunting from very early times. Many words for hunting in the Chinese language are written with the radical for dog - for example, ''lie'' (獵: hunt), ''shou'' (狩: winter hunt), ''huo'' (獲: bird hunt).

The Shang kings recognised ""Dog Officers"" (犬) who were involved in hunting in a specific area beyond the royal domain. One oracle bone records: ""If the king joins with Qin, the Dog Officer at Cheng, there will be no regrets and he will have no disasters."" 

There is one reference to dogs in the ''[[Shi Jing]]'', China's earliest anthology of [[poetry]]:
<poem>
     Dashing about is the crafty rabbit,
     But even a dumb dog can catch it.<ref>In Chinese: 躍躍毚兔 遇犬獲之. From Song 198, translated in Arthur Waley, ''The Book of Songs'' (New York: Grove Press, 1996) at 180.</ref>
</poem>

In the [[Warring States]] period, the kingdoms of Han and Yan were thought to produce the best hunting dogs. 

Because of their importance and numbers, there was at Shanglin an ""inspector of kennels"" (狗監; ''goujian'') who oversaw the raising and training of the hunting dogs for the Han court. 

There is pictorial evidence from early Han tomb tiles of large dogs with collars in the typical pointing position - the body in a slightly crouching position, neck extended horiontally, and one forepaw being under and raised several inches above ground - standing before a flock of geese in flight and several running deer.<ref>Thomas T. Allsen, ''The Royal Hunt in Eurasian History'' (Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006) at 57.</ref>

== Cultural perceptions ==

It is clear from the role of dogs in ceremony and as food that they were held in some esteem. 

[[Book of Rites]], ch.4, quotes [[Confucius]] ordering his disciple to perform the respectful burial for his dog and saying: 
{{quote|""I have heard that it is best not to throw away old and frayed carriage curtains because one can use them to bury horses; that it is best not to throw away old and frayed carriage canopies because one can use them to bury dogs. I am poor and have no carriage canopy. So use my mat when you put the dog into his grave. Be sure not to let his head get stuck in the mud.""<ref>仲尼之畜狗死，使子貢埋之，曰：「吾聞之也：敝帷不棄，為埋馬也；敝蓋不棄，為埋狗也。丘也貧，無蓋；於其封也，亦予之席，毋使其首陷焉。」[http://ctext.org/liji/tan-gong-ii], 203. Translation from Chin, Annping. ''Confucius: a Life of Thought and Politics''. Yale University Press, 2008:183-4.</ref>}}
 
Nevertheless, classical literature usually qualified dogs as ''hui'' treacherous, ''jiao'' crafty and ''si'' restless{{facts|date=October 2011}}. The [[Quanrong]] （犬戎）, literally ""Dog nomad-tribe"", were enemies of the settled civilizations from the time of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] onwards. The tribe claimed descendancy from two large white dogs and worshipped a totem in their honor.

The word for dog was sometimes used in human names. [[Sima Xiangru]], for example, had the nickname Quanzi (犬子), meaning ""pup"".

===Dogs in legend===
{{main article|Dog in Chinese mythology}}

According to ancient folk legends, [[solar eclipse]]s take place because dogs in heaven eat the sun. In order to save the sun from demise, ancient people formed the habit of beating drums and gongs at the critical moment to drive away the dogs.

A '''dog biscuit''' is a hard [[biscuit]]-based [[dietary supplement]] for [[dog]]s or other [[Canidae|canine]]s, similar to human [[snack food]].

Dog biscuits tend to be hard and dry. Dog biscuits may be sold in a flat bone-shape. Some manufacturers claim the dry and hard biscuit texture helps clean the dog's teeth, promoting oral health.

{{quote|text=In the south of England it is much the fashion to give sporting-dogs a food called dog-biscuit instead of barley-meal, and the consequences resulting from this simple aliment are most gratifying. Barley-meal, indeed, is an unnatural food, unless it be varied with bones, for a dog delights to gnaw, and thus to exercise those potent teeth with which nature has furnished him ; his stomach, too, is. designed to digest the hard and tough integument of animal substance; hence, barleymeal, as a principal portion of his subsistence, is by no means to he desired. In small private families it is not always possible to ohtain a sufficiency of meat and bones for the sustenance of a dog, and recourse is too frequently had to a coarse and filthy aliment, which is highly objectionable, especially if the creature be debarred from taking daily exercise, fettered by a chain, and restricted, by situation, from obtaining access to grass ; and no one who has not watched the habits of our faithful allies (as we have done), can be aware of the absolute necessity which exists for his obtaining a constant supply of it. If no other good effect resulted from it than the sleekness of his coat and clearness of his skin, these benefits ought to he procured for him; but when his health and comfort are to be also ensured, who, that has a grain of benevolence in his disposition, would hesitate to perform so simple and gratifying an act of duty?

Dog-biscuit is a hard and well-baked mass of coarse, yet clean and wholesome flour, of an inferior kind to that known as sailors' biscuit; and this latter substance, indeed, would be the best substitute for the former with which we are acquainted. A bag of dog-biscuit of five shillings' value, will be an ample supply for a yard-dog during the year: it should be soaked in water, or "" pot liquor,"" for an hour or two ; and if no meat be at hand, a little dripping or lard may be added to it while softening, which will make a relishing meal at a trifling cost. We have for many years known the utility of the plan thus advocated, and we earnestly recommend all who value the safety of the community and their own (to say nothing of the happiness of the canine race), to make trial of the rational and feasible plan which we have detailed.""

In later years, dog biscuits began to be made of meat products and were sometimes treated as synonymous with [[dog food]]. In 1871, an ad appeared in ''Cassell's Illustrated Almanac'' for ""SLATER'S MEAT BISCUIT FOR DOGS - Contains vegetable substances and about 25 per cent of Prepared Meat. It gives Dogs endurance, and without any other food will keep them in fine working condition.""<ref>1871 Cassell's Illustrated Almanac https://books.google.com/books?pg=PR132&dq=%22dog+food%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1890&cd=63&id=kCcOAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=%22dog%20food%22&f=false</ref>

In England, Spratt's Dog Biscuits not only obtained a patent but seems to have claimed to have invented the food:

{{quote|text=By most accounts, the history of the industry begins with a man named James Spratt. An electrician from Cincinnati, Spratt had patented a new type of lightning conductor in 1850. Later in the decade, he traveled to England to sell it. According to industry lore, he had a quayside epiphany in London when he saw a group of dogs eating discarded hardtack, the cheap, tough biscuits carried on ships and known to sailors as ""molar breakers."" The first major chunk of today's pet industry was born.
In 1860, still in England, Spratt unveiled Spratt's Patent Meat Fibrine Dog Cakes, a combination of wheat, beetroot, vegetables, and beef blood. Before long, he had competitors with names like Dr. A. C. Daniels' Medicated Dog Bread and F. H. Bennett's Malatoid Dog Biscuits. The products embraced the dubious science and the lightly regulated hucksterism of their era. (2009)<ref>Michael Schaffer,''One Nation Under Dog: Adventures in the New World of Prozac-Popping Puppies'', 2009, p. 2005 https://books.google.com/books?id=GMc7M4_2Z3MC&pg=PA205&dq=Spratt%27s+Patent+Dog+Biscuit&cd=9#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>}}
 
{{quote|text=More than 70 years ago, in a little shop in London an electrician named James Spratt conducted experiments which led to the production of Spratt's Patent—a scientifically blended dog food. It was the first attempt to lift the dog out of the class of scavenger which he had occupied from caveman times. The market was untouched, and in those early days, Spratt's Patent secured a bull-dog grip on it that it has never relinquished, despite the fact that in the past seventy years many competitors have tried to wrest the leadership from them.

In at least one case (in 1886) Spratt sued a seller accused of substituting another product - an early example of a company fighting ""knock-offs"":

{{quote|text=Spratt's Dog Biscuits.

On Wednesday last, in the Quean's Bench Division of the High Court, before Lord Coleridge and a special jury. Spratt's Patent Company claimed an injunction against a Mr. Warnett, a general dealer at St. Albans, who, they alleged, was selling as theirs certain meat biscuits for dogs not of their manufacture. They also asked for an account of profits, and damages and costs.

The case for the plaintiffs was that for many years they and their predecessor, James Spratt, had manufactured and sold, under patents of 1868 and 1881, meat biscuits for feeding dogs, the full name or description of which is "" Spratt's Patent Meat Fibrine Dog Cakes,"" but which are often designated by them, and are commonly known in the trade, as "" Spratt's Fibrine Biscuits,"" or "" Spratt's Dog Biscuits,"" or "" Spratt's Dog Cakes,"" or "" Spratt's Meat Biscuits,"" or "" Spratt's Patent Biscuits,"" or "" Patent Dog Biscuits,"" all which, as the plaintiffs asserted, indicated biscuits of their manufacture and no other. These biscuits are made in a square form, and each is stamped with the words "" Spratt's Patent"" and with a + in the centre. It was alleged that "" the biscuits have been found most valuable as food for dogs, and have acquired a great reputation."" They are in large demand, and the plaintiffs make considerable profits from the sale thereof, which profits would be considerably larger but that, as they alleged, fraudulent imitations are frequently palmed off upon the public as the biscuits of the plaintiffs, and then it was charged that the defendant had, in fraud of the plaintiffs and of the public, "" been selling to the public, as genuine dog biscuits of the plaintiffs' manufacture, biscuits which are not of the plaintiffs' manufacture, but are a fraudulent imitation thereof as to shape and appearance, and which do not contain the ingredients of the plaintiffs' biscuits."" Then several instances were stated in which persons who sent to the shop of the defendant to ask for Spratt's dog biscuits received other biscuits similar, as was alleged, to the plaintiffs' in size, appearance, and weight, the only difference being that, in lieu of the words "" Spratt's Patent "" and the cross, the biscuits sold were stamped with a hexagon and the words "" American meat.""

Mr. Horton Smith, Q.C., in opening the case for the plaintiffs, said that, suspecting that their biscuits were being pirated by the defendant, they adopted the usual course of sending persons to his shop to ask for Spratt's dog biscuits, and in every instance Benton's American meat biscuits, which were similar in shape, size, and general character, were delivered.

Spratt lost in this case and the judge regretted that he could not grant the defendant court costs.

At one point after this, as an industrial product, dog biscuits were classified in the same category as soap: ""Of the making of dog biscuits, which the census places in the same category with soap, as using animal refuse from which soap grease has been extracted, it is unnecessary to say much.""<ref>Charles Booth, ''Life and labour of the people in London'', v 6,  1892-1903 p118 http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k93987x.image.hl.r=biscuit.f132.langEN</ref>

Spratt dominated the American market until 1907, when F. H. Bennett, whose own dog biscuits were faring poorly against those of the larger company, had the idea of making them in the shape of a bone.

'''Breed type''' in the parlance of [[Animal fancy|dog fanciers]] refers to the qualities that define a [[dog breed]] and separate it from all other dog breeds. ''Breed type'' is outlined in the written [[Breed standard (dogs)|standard]] for each breed, and ''breed type'' is the basis of [[Dog-show judge|judging]] in [[Conformation show|conformation dog shows]].

==Qualities that define a breed==
''[[Breed type]]'' encompasses appearance, character, condition, bone structure, temperament, and movement; ""breed type is all these things.""<ref>{{Citation | last =Rose | first =Sue | author-link = | title =Breed Type (judging seminar notes) | publisher =English Cocker Spaniel Club of America | url =http://www.ecsca.org/breedtype.html | accessdate =2008-05-14}}</ref> ''Breed type'' also includes a character specific to each breed, a combination of behaviour, temperament and carriage that demonstrate an essence of the breed.<ref>{{Citation | last =Beauchamp | first =Richard | author-link = | publication-date =2008 | title =Solving the Mysteries of Breed Type | edition =2nd | publisher =Doral Publishing | isbn =978-1-59378-663-2 | year =2008}}</ref> ""He exuded breed type,"" writes Anne Marie Rasmussen of a particular King Charles Spaniel.<ref>{{Citation | last =Rasmussen | first =Anne Marie | author-link = | title =Understanding Line Breeding | publisher =Cavaliers.co.uk, 'The number one site for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed in the UK' | url =http://www.cavaliers.co.uk/articles/linebreeding.htm | accessdate =2008-05-14}}</ref> An Akbash Dog ""with correct breed type [is] confident, protective, intelligent, brave, affectionate yet reserved, and always loyal.""<ref>{{Citation|last=Nelson |first=Judith |publication-date=March 1993 |title=Akbash Dogs: A Breed Apart |publisher=Dog Fancy Magazine |pages=40–41 |url=http://www.flockguard.org/akbashbreedapart.htm |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501204324/http://www.flockguard.org/akbashbreedapart.htm |archivedate=1 May 2008 }}</ref> The exact definition of ''breed type'' for any given breed can be very subjective and elusive.

==The Standard==
For the most part, the ideal ''breed type'' is defined in the breed standard, a written list of attributes that defines the breed and separates the breed from other breeds based on the same ancestral [[Dog type|type]]. The standard leaves room for interpretation; [[Dog breeding|breeders]] may choose to select for emphasis some aspects of ''breed type'' over others, and, if conformation judges agree with that selection, the breed will change over time.<ref>{{Citation | last =Caras | first =Roger A. | author-link = | publication-date =2001 | title =Going for the Blue, Inside the World of Show dogs and Dog Shows | publication-place =New York | publisher =Warner Books, Inc. | page =13 | isbn =0-446-52644-4 | year =2001}}</ref>

Each element of the standard is considered both independently and part of the whole of ''breed type''. In writing about the Borzoi, Jon Titus Steel says, ""The neck is a key element of breed type"", affecting a dog's outline, balance, movement, and function.<ref>{{Citation | last =Steele | first =Jon Titus | author-link = | publication-date =May 2008 | title =The Neck - Element of Function and Grace | periodical =American Kennel Club Gazette | publication-place =New York | publisher =American Kennel Club | page =55}}</ref>

==Judging==
In conformation judging, judges compare the dog to the ideal ''breed type'' represented in the standard.<ref>{{Citation | last =Grossman | first =Dr. Alvin | author-link = | publication-date =1998 | title =Understanding How Dog Shows Work | publisher =Doral Publishing, Inc. Online Catalog | url =http://www.doralpub.com/doral/dshowtip.html | accessdate =2008-05-14}}</ref> Since breed standards leave room for interpretation, conformation show judging is highly subjective, and individual judges will place more or less emphasis on the various elements of ''breed type''. In addition, all-breed judges may not be knowledgeable about all of the details of each breed's ''breed type''. The director of the Bedlington Terrier Club of America writes of the Bedlington Terrier's standard for gait that ""all too often, judges either ignore [the standard's] description or completely lack knowledge of it.""<ref>{{Citation | last =Friesen | first =Laurie | author-link = | publication-date =May 2008 | title =Unique Bedlington Movement | periodical =American Kennel Club Gazette | publication-place =New York | publisher =American Kennel Club | pages =67}}</ref>

Even judging that adheres strictly to the standard tends to reward the most outgoing and energetic (showy) dog. In order to win, showing ""must be fun for the dog.""<ref>{{Citation | last =Alston | first =George G. | author-link = | publication-date =1992 | title =The Winning Edge | publication-place =New York, Toronto | publisher =Howell Book House | page =59 | isbn =0-87605-834-9 | year =1992}}</ref> But for some breeds, excessive showiness is in opposition to the ''breed type'' and should not be rewarded. The American Kennel Club [[English Mastiff]] standard cautions, ""Judges should also beware of putting a premium on showiness.""<ref>[http://www.akc.org/breeds/mastiff/ American Kennel Club Mastiff standard] (Retrieved on 14 May 2008)</ref>

== ''Breed type'' and performance ==
''Breed type'' usually takes into account the work the original dog type from which the breed was developed was bred to do. In order to counterbalance the overuse of appearance in awarding championships, some major registries and breed clubs have instituted performance events as part of the awards at conformation shows.<ref>The United Kennel Club (US) has a Total Dog Award for dogs that win both conformation and a performance event on the same day. See the United Kennel Club [http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Rules/DEConfoNonlicensedConformationClasses Dog Events Rules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208202253/http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/Rules/DEConfoNonlicensedConformationClasses |date=8 December 2008 }}.

== Types, ''type'', and breeds ==
[[Dog type]], ''breed type'', [[dog breed]], and [[Purebred|purebred dog]] breed are at times all used interchangeably, but they all have distinct meanings. ''Types of dogs'' are varieties developed for a specific work; they may be very ancient or modern in origin. ''Modern breeds of dogs'' are refinements of older dog types, bred so that all closely resemble each other, and documented in a stud book kept by a breed club or major dog registry. A ''purebred dog'' is a dog of a documented modern dog breed that has been selectively bred to emphasize ''breed type'' for the sport of competitive conformation dog showing.

The word ''type'' may be incorrectly used instead of ''style'' to refer to an identifiable  'style of appearance' or 'working style characteristic' of a particular kennel or ""dogs of a well established line""  '''This terminology is incorrect.'''  The word ''type'' in reference to a dog refers specifically to the description of what defines that breed and what makes that breed of dog different from every other breed, as can be found in that breed's written Standard. When comparing dogs of the same breed, you look at ''type'' first and foremost, and then you look for different ''styles'' of dogs within that breed.  The term ''style'' refers to characteristics that are different in each dog that already has ''breed type''. There can be a vast variety of ''styles'' existing in each breed of dog.  These characteristics develop from a breeder's desire to create a distinct 'look' (or ''style'') within their line. Breeders create their own ''style'' within their line, being careful not to stray from ''breed type''.

'''Canid hybrids''' are the result of interbreeding between different species of the canine (dog) family (genus ''[[Canis]]''). They often occur in the wild, in particular between domestic or feral dogs and wild native canids.<ref>[http://petsaspests.blogspot.com.es/search/label/Canid%20hybridization Review of articles on Dog hybridisation in the wild], petsaspests.blogspot.com.es</ref>

==Genetic considerations==
The wolf-like canids are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their [[chromosome]]s number 78. The group includes genus ''Canis'', ''Cuon'' and ''Lycaon''. The members are the [[dog]] ''(C. lupus familiaris)'', [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus''),  [[coyote]] (''C. latrans''), [[golden jackal]] (''C. aureus''), [[Ethiopian wolf]] (''C. simensis''), [[black-backed jackal]] (''C. mesomelas''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''C. adustus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), and [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'').<ref name=wayne1993/> Newly proposed members include the [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), [[eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), and [[African golden wolf]] (''C. anthus''). As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus ''Canis'' (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are [[Karyology|karyologically]] indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog.<ref name=wurster1982/><ref name=wayne2006/>{{rp|p279}} The members of ''Canis'' can potentially [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]].<ref name=wayne1999/>

When the differences in number and arrangement of chromosomes is too great, hybridization becomes less and less likely.  The wolf, dingo, dog, coyote, and golden jackal all have 78 [[chromosome]]s arranged in 39 pairs.<ref name=Population>{{cite book|title=Conservation genetics: case histories from nature|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Norwell, Massachusetts, USA|isbn=0-412-05581-3|author=Wayne, R.K.|authorlink=Conservation Genetics in the Canidae|editor1=Avise, J.C. |editor2=Hamerick, J.L. |pages=75–118}}</ref>   This allows them to hybridize freely (barring size or behavioral constraints) and produce fertile offspring.

Other members of the wider dog family, the [[Canidae]], such as [[Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships|South American canids]], [[true fox]]es, [[bat-eared fox]]es, or [[raccoon dog]]s which diverged seven to ten million years ago, are less closely related to and cannot hybridize with the wolf-like canids<ref name=Population/> because the [[red fox]] has 34 [[Centromere#Metacentric|metacentric]] chromosomes and from 0 to 8 small B chromosomes,<ref>http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/ccgr/behaviour/Fox_Genome.htm</ref> the raccoon dog has 42 chromosomes, and the [[fennec fox]] has 64 chromosomes.

==Legality==

Dog hybrids kept as pets are prohibited in certain jurisdictions, or are classed as wild animals and must be housed in the same way as purebred wolves.

In the United States legislation differs greatly from state to state. In New York, the law does not allow an individual to house or own a dog hybrid of any kind, even if there is a low percentage of wolf genes in the hybrid.<ref name=""adirondackwildlife.org"">http://www.adirondackwildlife.org/Cree012807BillW.html.

[[File:Czechoslovakian-wolfdog-profile big.jpg|thumb|A [[Czechoslovakian Wolfdog]]]]
The domestic [[dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') is a domesticated form of the [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus lupus'') and therefore belongs to the same species as other wolves, such as the [[dingo]] (''Canis lupus dingo''). Therefore, crosses between these sub-species are biologically unremarkable and not a hybridization in the same sense as an interbreeding between different species of ''Canidae''.

Wolves are different from domestic dogs in that wolves usually have slimmer chests, longer legs, and they also have stronger jaws than that of the domestic subspecies.<ref name=""nal.usda.gov"">Willems,Robert A. (2013).http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/newsletters/v5n4/5n4wille.htm#toc3. Animal Welfare Information Center Newsletter, Volume 5, Number 4, Winter 1994/1995. Retrieved 16 September 2013.</ref> The difference in appearance from the wolf to the domestic dog becomes even larger when a mix of the two animals is created. Wolfdogs do not have one common description of their appearance because it varies from one breeding cycle to the next.<ref name=""nal.usda.gov""/> It differs from cycle to cycle because the number of wolf genes inherited in the animal differs greatly and is recorded in a percentage form. The general layout for describing the percentage of wolfdogs is as follows: 1-49% is considered low content (LC), 50-74% is considered to be mid-content (MC), and 75% and higher is considered to be high content (HC).<ref>http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/w/wolfdog.htm. Retrieved 16 September 2013.</ref> The percentage of the amount of wolf in a wolfdog decides what the animal will look like. For example, if a wolfdog is 25% husky and 75% wolf, it will appear more like a wolf than a husky because it contains more genes from the wolf.<ref name=""adirondackwildlife.org""/> This means that the appearance of the wolfdog will most likely contain a narrower chest, longer legs, and sharper teeth because it inherited more traits from the wolf parent.<ref>http://www.adirondackwildlife.org/Cree012807BillW.html. retrieved 16 September 2013.</ref>

People wanting to improve domestic dogs or create an [[exotic pet]] may breed domestic dogs to wolves. Gray wolves have been crossed with dogs that have a wolf-like appearance, such as [[Siberian Husky|Siberian huskies]], and [[Alaskan Malamute|Alaskan malamutes]]. The breeding of wolf–dog crosses is controversial, with opponents purporting that it produces an animal unfit as a domestic pet. A number of wolfdog breeds are in development. The first generation crosses (one wolf parent, one dog parent) generally are [[Backcrossing|backcrossed]] to domestic dogs to maintain a domestic temperament and consistent conformation.

===Dingo hybrids===
{{Main article|Interbreeding of dingoes with other domestic dogs}}
[[File:Dingo, just relaxing.jpg|thumb|right|A dingo with an unusual color pattern]]
The [[dingo]] (''Canis lupus dingo'') breeds freely with other domestic dogs.  This is now so widespread that in some areas, dingoes are now mostly [[mixed-breed dog]]s, crossed in recent times with dogs from other parts of the world.  However, DNA study shows that ""the dingo originates from domesticated dogs, originally from East Asia""<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.asianscientist.com/in-the-lab/native-australian-dingo-originated-in-south-china-university-of-new-south-wales/ |title=Crikey! The Native Australian Dingo Was Originally From South China? |first=Juliana  |last=Chan |work=Asian Scientist Magazine |date=September 9, 2011 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> (which [[Feral|reverted to the wild]]) and so interbreeding between dingos and other domestic dogs is also not a hybridization in the same sense as an interbreeding between different species of ''Canidae''.

Some dingo hybrids are accepted back into the wild dingo population, where they breed with pure dingoes.  In some parts of Australia, up to 80% of dingoes are part domestic dog.  Dingoes are distinguishable from domestic dogs through [[DNA]] and through having longer teeth and longer muzzles.

The [[Australian Kelpie|Australian kelpie]] is widely believed to be the result of crossing dingos with English herding dogs, but this (the dingo blood) is not upheld by breed documentation.{{who|date=February 2013}}  The [[Australian Cattle Dog|Australian cattle dog]] and [[stumpy-tail cattle dog]] breeds are known to have been influenced by the dingo.

According to the partwork ""Animal Life and the World of Nature"" (Vol 1, 1902 – 1903), Lord Walter Rothschild owned a dingo–wolf cross, bred by Mr. and Mrs. HC Brooke from a tame male dingo and a semi-tame female wolf.

==Coyote hybrids==
{{see also|Coyote#Interspecific hybridization}}

===Coyote–dog hybrid===

====Coydog====
{{Main article|Coydog}}
'''Coydogs''' (the offspring of a male coyote and female dog) are naturally occurring red or blond color variations of the coyote or were feral dogs. The breeding cycles of dogs and coyotes are not synchronized and this makes interbreeding uncommon. If interbreeding had been common, each successive generation of the coyote population would have acquired more and more dog-like traits.

===Coywolves===
{{Main article|Coywolf}}
[[File:Coywolf hybrids.jpg|thumb|Captive-bred [[F1 hybrid|F<sub>1</sub>]] gray wolf-coyote hybrids, Wildlife Science Center in [[Forest Lake, Minnesota]]]]
Hybridization between gray wolf and coyote has long been recognized both in the wild and in captivity. In an evolutionary biology research conducted by a team of researchers in the Uppsala University, analysis of control region haplotypes of the mitochondrial DNA and sex chromosomes from Mexican wolves, a critically endangered subspecies of the grey wolf once nearly driven to extinction in the wild, confirmed the presence of coyote markers in some of the wolves.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Frank |last1=Hailer |first2=Jennifer A. |last2=Leonard |url= http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003333 |title=Hybridization among Three Native North American Canis Species in a Region of Natural Sympatry |work=plosone.org |year=2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> The study suggests that at some point in time, female coyotes managed to mate with some of the male wolves of the remnant wild Mexican wolf populations. Analysis on the haplotype of some coyotes from Texas also detected the presence of male wolf introgression such as Y chromosomes from the grey wolves in the southern coyotes. In one cryptology investigation on a corpse of what was initially labelled as a [[chupacabra]], examinations conducted by the UC Davis team and the Texas State University concluded based on the sex chromosomes that the male animal was in fact another coyote and wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican wolf.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kens5.com/news/in-depth/chasing-el-chupacabra/UC-Davis-team-says-chupacabra-is-likely-coyote-wolf-mix-85788362.html |title=UC-Davis team says chupacabra is likely coyote, wolf mix  |work=[[KENS]] |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

DNA analysis consistently shows that all existing [[Red wolf|red wolves]] carry coyote genes. This has caused a problem for Canid taxonomy, as hybrids are not normally thought of as species, though the convention is to continue to refer to red wolves as a subspecies of wolf, ''Canis lupus rufus'', with no mention of the coyote taxon, ''latrans''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.canids.org/PUBLICAT/CNDNEWS3/2conserv.htm |title=Red Wolves: to Conserve or not to Conserve |first=Bob |last=Wayne |work=canids.org |year=2008 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14000738 |title=Mammal Species of the World : Lupus |work=[[Bucknell University]] |year=2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

In recent history, the taxonomic status of the red wolf has been widely debated. Mech (1970) suggested that red wolves may be fertile hybrid offspring from gray wolf (''Canis lupus'') and coyote (''C. latrans'') interbreeding. Wayne and Jenks (1991) and Roy et al. (1994b, 1996) supported this suggestion with genetic analysis. Phillips and Henry (1992) present logic supporting the contention that the red wolf is a subspecies of gray wolf. However, recent genetic and morphological evidence suggests that the red wolf is a unique taxon. Wilson et al. (2000) report that gray wolves (''Canis lupus lycaon'') in southern Ontario appear genetically very similar to the red wolf and that these two canids may be subspecies of one another and not a subspecies of gray wolf. Wilson et al. (2000) propose that red wolves and ''C. lupus lycaon'' should be a separate species, ''C. lycaon'', with their minor differences acknowledged via subspecies designation. North American wolf biologists and geneticists also concluded that ''C. rufus'' and ''C. lupus lycaon'' were genetically more similar to each other than either was to ''C. lupus'' or ''C. latrans'' (B.T. Kelly unpubl.). In 2002 orphometric analyses of skulls also indicate that the red wolf is likely not to be a gray wolf–coyote hybrid (Nowak 2002). Therefore, while the red wolf's taxonomic status remains unclear, there is mounting evidence to support ''C. rufus'' as a unique canid taxon.<ref>{{cite book |title=Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs - 2004 Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |chapter=Chapter 4.

Many animals commonly referred to as ""[[eastern coyote]]s"" or ""[[Eastern coyote|northeastern coyote]]s"" has become a problem for taxonomists, as it is unclear what new taxon will be used to refer to this new population of animals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/The-yowl-of-the-suburbs-612669.php |title=The yowl of the suburbs |first=Paul |last=Grondahl |work=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

*In [[Russia]], golden jackal/[[Lapponian Herder|Lapponian herder]] hybrids were bred as sniffer dogs because jackals have a superior sense of smell and Lapponian herders are good cold climate dogs.  Also, [[Fox Terrier|fox terrier]], [[Norwegian Lundehund|Norwegian lundehund]], and [[Spitz]] blood were combined to create the [[Sulimov Dog|Sulimov dog]].<ref>Viegas, Jennifer. Animal Planet: [http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/200205/jackaldog.html Jackal-Dog Created for Airport Security]</ref>  As well as a superior sense of smell, important at low temperatures where substances are less volatile and therefore less pungent, Sulimov dogs are small-sized and can work in confined spaces.  When tired, their normally curled tails droop, making it clear to the handler that the dog needs to be rested.  The jackal hybrids were bred by Klim Sulimov, senior research assistant at the D.S. Likhachev Scientific Research Institute for Cultural Heritage and Environmental Protection in Russia. Male jackal pups had to be fostered on a husky bitch in order to imprint the jackals on dogs.  Female jackals accepted male huskies more readily.  The half-bred jackal-dogs were difficult to train and were bred back to huskies to produce quarter-bred hybrids (quadroons).  These hybrids were small, agile, trainable and had an excellent sense of smell.  Twenty-five jackal-dog hybrids are used by [[Aeroflot]] at [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] in [[Moscow]] for functions including bomb-sniffing.  Their breeding program dates back to 1975, but it was not applied to bomb detection until 2002.

'''Physical therapy''' for canines, or '''canine rehabilitation''', adapts human physical therapy techniques to increase function and mobility of joints and muscles in animals.  Animal rehabilitation can reduce pain and enhance recovery from injury, surgery, degenerative diseases, age-related diseases, and obesity.<ref>Hellyer P, Rodan I, Brunt J, Downing R, Hagedorn J, Robertson S. 2007. AAHA/AAFP Pain Management guidelines for dogs and cats. J Am Anim Hosp Assoc. 43:235-248.</ref>

The goal of physical therapy for animals is to improve quality of life and decrease pain.  Although most veterinary practices offering physical therapy are geared toward canines, techniques used in this discipline can also be applied to horses, cats, birds, rabbits, rodents and other small animals.<ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

== History ==
The benefits of physical therapy for animals have been widely accepted in the veterinary community for many years.  However, clinical practice of physical therapy for animals is a relatively new field in the U.S.  In Europe, [[equine]] and canine physical therapy have been  widely recommended and used for at least the last fifteen years.  In the last three to five years, the veterinary community in the U.S. has seen a large growth in physical therapy practices for animals, making it a more available resource for practicing veterinarians.  This growth in the availability of canine physical therapy is forcing a change in focus in many veterinary practices from [[Curative care|curative]] and [[palliative care]] to [[preventive care]]. An example of this is the push for the use of animal physical therapy for weight reduction in obese animals.  Weight reduction can reduce the risk of developing many degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis and [[Degenerative joint disease|DJD]].<ref>Mlacnik E, Bockstahler B, Muller M, Tetrick M, Nap R, Zentek J. 2006. Effects of caloric restriction and a moderate or intense physiotherapy program for treatment of lameness in overweight dogs with osteoarthritis. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 229(11):1756-1760.</ref><ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

== Education ==
Canine rehabilitation is an AVMA boarded specialty through the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation. Diplomates (Specialists)of this college advance the art and science of veterinary medicine by promoting expertise in the structural, physiological, medical and surgical needs of athletic animals and the restoration of normal form and function after injury or illness. These specialists have special training and educational requirements above and beyond a veterinary degree and are identified as Diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation ( DACVSMR). <ref>http://vsmr.org/</ref>

Canine rehabilitation is also practiced by general veterinarians and physical therapists with specialized training. If your pet is being treated by a physical therapist that pet generally must have a diagnosis and referral by a veterinarian to start a physical rehabilitation regime.  A certified canine rehabilitation practitioner (CCRP) is one designation for veterinarians, veterinary technicians, physical therapists, or physical therapist assistants who perform physical rehabilitation and is offered through Northeast Seminars with affiliation with the University of Tennessee outreach program.  A CCRT certification is available through the Canine Rehabilitation Institute in Florida and Colorado--affiliated with Colorado State University.  Other more extensive and individualized training and online offerings are available as well.  

=== The University of Tennessee ===
The [[University of Tennessee]] currently offers post-graduate courses and certification for CCRPs through their canine rehabilitation program. This program is directed by [[David F. Levine]] and Darryl Mills, and is taught by a combination of veterinarians and canine physical therapists. Educational topics offered include orthopedics, pain management, joint mobilization, and many others. These courses are offered to qualified veterinarians, veterinary technicians, physical therapists, physical therapy assistants, and occupational therapists. Course work is blended between on-site seminars and online courses.<ref>http://www.utcaninerehab.com/</ref>

== Techniques ==
In an animal physical therapy practice, a CCRP usually confers with the diagnosing veterinarian on the cause and severity of an animal's condition to develop a specialized therapy plan on a client by client basis.  Each technique used in animal physical therapy has different benefits and not all techniques are useful for each condition.  Physical therapy for orthopedic conditions can include any combination of the following techniques: thermotherapy, cryotherapy, hydrotherapy, muscle building exercises electrical stimulation and coordination exercises.  Neurological conditions generally benefit the most from balance and coordination building exercises, muscle building exercises, electrical stimulation and hydrotherapy.  Surgical repairs and traumatic injuries are generally treated with heat therapy, cryotherapy, massage, electrical stimulation, and hydrotherapy.<ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Massage ===
{{main|Canine massage}}
Massage is used in animal physical therapy to relieve tension in muscles and stimulate muscle development.  Massage helps speed up recovery from injuries and surgery by increasing blood flow to the area and relieving muscle spasms.  Massage is used widely in canine physical therapy and can be helpful in improving the comfort of animals affected by nearly all medical conditions.<ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Thermo and cryotherapy ===
[[Thermotherapy]] is generally used in animal physical therapy before strength building exercises and hydrotherapy.  Heat packs are applied to the affected area to increase range of motion, decrease stiffness in joints and increase blood flow.  This helps to make the animal more comfortable in the application of other physical therapy techniques.  Deep heating of the muscle by laser therapy is often used to stimulate healing of surface wounds and relieve pain and discomfort of constricted and sore muscles.  [[Cryotherapy]] is often used after an intensive physical therapy session to decrease discomfort caused by inflammation of the muscle.<ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Passive range of motion ===
Passive range of motion (PROM) is accomplished through flexion and extension of the joint to its limits.  It is important for the physical therapist not to stretch the joint past its normal limits.  PROM is used to encourage animals to use the full range of motion of the joints.  This therapy technique can significantly increase an animal's range of motion and decrease joint pain, improving its quality of life.<ref>Crook T, McGowan C, Pead M. 2007. Effect of passive stretching on the range of motion of osteoarthritic joints in 10 Labrador retrievers. Vet Rec. 160(16):545-547.</ref><ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Balance Exercises ===
Balance exercises make use of equipment designed to strengthen weak muscles and build up limbs affected by [[atrophy]].  These exercises include balancing on physio-balls, wobble boards and balance boards.  Balance exercises can be useful in animals recovering from surgery.  The animal is forced to place weight on the surgical repair, building muscle in the affected area.  These exercises can also be helpful for animals with neurological conditions.  For example, an animal recovering from a stroke has decreased coordination and balance which can be improved through a physical therapy regime that includes balance exercises.<ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Coordination exercises ===
Coordination exercises help improve an animal's awareness of its surroundings.  Such exercises include [[cavaletti]]s, weaves, and figure eights.  Cavaletti is an exercise that gives an animal obstacles to walk over.  This exercise makes the animal focus on where each foot is being placed and builds coordination.  Weaves and figure eights help to build coordination and strength by forcing the animal to shift its weight quickly from one side to the other as it turns.  These exercises are very useful in dogs suffering from [[Neurological disorder|neurological conditions]] and spinal cord injuries.<ref>Holler P, Brazda V, Dal-Bianco B, Lewy E, Mueller M, Peham C, Bockstahler B. 2010. Kinematic motion analysis of the  joints of the forelimbs and hind limbs of dogs during walking exercise regimens.  Am J Vet Res. 71(7):734-740.</ref>

=== Strengthening exercises ===
These exercises include uphill and downhill walking, stairs, standing on 2 or 3 legs, ramps, and sit-to-stands.  Uphill and downhill walking are effective physical therapy techniques for increasing flexion of the hip joint.  This is a good technique for stretching the hip joint and increasing range of motion in dogs with hip dysplasia and degenerative joint disease.  Walking up and down stairs forces an animal's weight to shift fully onto its front or hind legs and builds muscle in the shoulders and thighs, respectively.  A simple but effective strengthening exercise for animals with surgical repairs is to force an animal to place more weight than they would normally on the affected limb by lifting the opposite leg.  If the physical therapist is attempting to build muscle in the right hind leg, they lift the left hind leg to shift weight onto the right hind leg.  To increase the difficulty of this exercise they lift both the right front and left hind legs.  Ramps work similarly to uphill and downhill walking.  The angle of the ramp can be altered to increase or decrease difficulty.  Sit-to-stands work similarly to squats in humans.  The animal is asked to sit square on its haunches and is then encouraged to push off its hind legs to stand up.  This exercise increases strength in the thigh and [[stifle joint]] of an animal.<ref>Holler P, Brazda V, Dal-Bianco B, Lewy E, Mueller M, Peham C, Bockstahler B. 2010. Kinematic motion analysis of the  joints of the forelimbs and hind limbs of dogs during walking exercise regimens.  Am J Vet Res. 71(7):734-740.</ref><ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Hydrotherapy ===
Hydrotherapy techniques use water as a tool to improve muscle and joint function in animals.  These techniques include but are not limited to swimming and underwater treadmill.  Swimming allows an animal to work several muscles at once while stretching further than walking on land would allow.  This helps to build muscle and endurance and is a technique that minimizes stress on the joints.  Underwater treadmill is used commonly in animal physical therapy.  It provides the benefits of land exercises while decreasing the weight placed on the animal’s limbs.  Underwater treadmill and swimming can be very useful in dogs recovering from surgery, such as [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and [[cranial cruciate ligament]] repairs and break repairs.<ref>Jurek C, McCauley L. [Updated 2010]. Underwater treadmill therapy in veterinary practice: Benefits and considerations. DVM 360. Available from: http://veterinarymedicine.dvm360.com/vetmed/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/591380.</ref><ref>Rivera PL. 2007. Canine Rehabilitation Therapies I and II. Proceedings of the 79th Annual Western Veterinary Conference; 2007 Feb 18-22; Las Vegas. 11p.</ref>

=== Electrical Stimulation ===
Electrical stimulation techniques uses electrical currents to either stimulate muscles or to combat pain. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is often used to help improve muscle strength, and/or motor recruitment. Trans-cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be used to help relieve the pain that the animal may be experiencing. These techniques are used along with the other techniques listed above.<ref>Mills D, Levine D. Canine Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy, 2e 2013. p342-53</ref>

=== Acupuncture ===
Acupuncture is used to treat various nerve and musculoskeletal issues in both small and large animals. It is used to combat pain and promote healing in the affected areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What is Veterinary Acupuncture?|url = https://www.ivas.org/about-ivas/what-is-veterinary-acupuncture/|website = IVAS|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}</ref>

Various sorts of '''dogs''' are known to have existed in prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]], as shown by archaeological and iconographical sources, and the testimonies of the 16th-century Spaniards. In the Central Mexican area, there were three races: the medium-sized furred dog (''itzcuintli''), the medium-sized hairless dog (''[[xoloitzcuintli]]''), and the short-legged, (''tlalchichi'') based in Colima and now extinct. Apart from other, more obvious functions, dogs were also used for food (10% of all consumed meat in [[Teotihuacan]]) and ritual sacrifice.
{{TOC right}}

==Maya used domesticated dogs==
The ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]]s, a group of people who lived throughout southern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], used domesticated [[dog]]s on a daily basis as a food source, hunting aide, and an element in religious and spiritual rituals.

==Archaeological evidence==
Remains of dogs have been found in sites dating from the [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic]] through the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] periods of [[Mesoamerica]] dating as early as 1200 BCE.  These remains have appeared in [[midden]]s, spread over yard surfaces, and near areas of sacrificial offerings. Since the deposits of dogs were discovered along with other plant and animal remains, it is difficult to decipher dog parts from those of other small mammals.  In [[Colha, Belize]], dog foot bones and teeth were found more than any other body part.

==Uses of dogs==
Despite the fact that the amount of dog use varied throughout time and place, people of the coastal regions of the Maya area placed more importance on dogs due to their constant availability as a source of protein and their ability to rapidly reproduce.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} Breeding and raising domesticated dogs required low energy use.  Fish and other hunted animals were not as reliable as dogs as a food resource, and it required more energy and time to capture these animals for consumption.  Overall, it is because of the comparison of dog deposits to other fauna and how the amount of dog deposits differs among sites from various periods.  Because of this variation, it is not certain if the function of dogs altered from a food source to that of a religious symbol over time.  Besides becoming a meal, dogs were also used as hunting and traveling companions and were scavengers in the home.

===Dogs as food===
During a portion of the Preclassic and Early Classic period (1200 BCE through 250 CE), dogs in [[Cuello]], Belize were bred and killed once they reached one year of age.  Dog bones had completed [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal fusion]] and did not indicate the normal pattern of wear like adult dogs who lived longer than a year.  Puppy remains were not found.  Dogs were castrated and fed [[maize]] until they were fat enough to be ready for slaughter.  Throughout the Preclassic period in the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán region]], dogs were not the primary meat supply, but archaeological evidence indicates they were a substantial part of the Maya diet.  In fact, at the Colha site, white-tailed deer accounted for up to fifty percent of the Maya meat source.  Starting in the Preclassic period, Maya elites served dogs during competitive feasts.  They were either stewed or were burned in a sacrificial ceremony.  Bones were chopped, broken, crushed and boiled to extract the marrow inside.

===Dog nutrition===
In addition to eating [[maize]], dogs ate household scraps.  There is no evidence for any kind of specialized diet for dogs.  Today, the [[Yucatec]] Maya continue to talk about their dog-eating ancestors and carry on the tradition of feeding dogs maize by giving them six to eight [[tortilla]]s daily.

===Breeds of dog===
Contemporary Maya have nine words for ""dog"" in their lexicon, not all of which correspond to separate breeds. It was documented in the sixteenth century by Spanish explorers in Mérida, Yucatán that dogs were bred locally in pens, fed maize, and sold at market.  Another type of dog recognized by Maya was the hairless [[xoloitzcuintli]], however, breeds are difficult to recognize archaeologically.

==Dogs in Maya culture and religion==
{{main|Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth}}

===Dogs in Maya literature===
In the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] creation story, dogs played important roles in certain events.  For example, the second attempt at creating humans turned disastrous when the gods made them out of wood.  The wooden humans were emotionless and would not feed the dogs.  In retaliation, the dogs became angry and destroyed them.  The moral of the story is “civilized” Maya make certain that dogs are fed on a decent human diet such as maize.  When dogs were used in ritual sacrifices, the act contained a dual meaning: a person gave respect to the dog by feeding it maize, which represent humans.  Humans were made of maize by the gods in the Popol Vuh.  Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero twins]] sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as [[Xibalba]].  After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life.  The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them.  In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life.  This made it possible for humans to live on earth.  The story linked dogs with renewal and human life.  Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld.  They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.

===Dog sacrifice and burial===
There are multiple situations in which dogs were used for sacrifice or burial.  Dog sacrifices were important in the political sphere for rituals concerning “...inaugurations and founding of new civic religious centres...”{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} There has also been confirmation of dog burials in [[Cozumel]] used in circumstances involving administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Dogs were associated with “new beginnings"" and were sacrificed instead of humans on the New Year ceremony.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Dogs with spots that looked like the color of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] were sacrificed during cacao rituals because they represented economic significance.  Landmarks linked to [[fertility]] and [[ancestor worship]] contain dog burials.  Dogs were found buried alongside humans in graves as well as in royal residences,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} presumably to guide their owners to the afterlife.

===Dogs in Maya art===
In Maya art, dogs are represented in various roles and media.  They have been depicted in scenes such as those from the Popol Vuh or burial processions.  The [http://www.mayavase.com Maya Vase Database] exhibits a great example of a possible funeral procession on a painted vase, [http://research.mayavase.com/kerrmaya_list.php?_allSearch=&hold_search=&vase_number=5534&date_added=&ms_number=&site=&x=0&y=0 K5534].  The dog standing below the head noble’s [[palanquin]] may be guiding its owner to Xibalba.

[[File:Dingo, just relaxing.jpg|thumb|right|A ""dingo"" with an unusual colour pattern]]

The '''interbreeding of dingoes with other domestic dogs''' is an ongoing process affecting the population of free ranging [[domestic dog]]s in [[Australia]]. The current population of free ranging domestic dogs in Australia is now probably higher than in the past. However, the proportion of the so-called ""pure""<ref>Since there is no unity on the subject what dogs should be regarded as dingoes and unknown whether the observed dingoes weren't hybrids, the term ''pure'' is written in quotations in this article.</ref> [[dingo]]es (dogs with exclusively dingo-ancestry) has been in the decrease over the last few decades and is regarded as further decreasing.

Because of this ongoing interbreeding of dingoes and other domestic dogs and the resulting [[mixed-breed dog|hybrid]]s, there is a much wider range of colours and body shapes today among the Australian wild dog population than in the time before the human introduction of domestic dogs. The full extent of the effects of this process is currently unknown and the possibility of potential problems, as well as the wish to preserve the ""pure"" dingo, often leads to a strong rejection of the interbreeding.<ref name=""impact"">Fleming, Corbett, Harden and Thomson (2001)</ref>

==Causes, degree, and forms of interbreeding==
According to present knowledge, the dingo arrived in Australia together with seafarers four millennia ago, and reverted to the wild there. The dingo has been proven to have existed on the continent for at least 3,500 years, which was confirmed by archaeological as well as genetic examinations and findings. Additionally, it was suspected that there was later no significant introduction of other domestic dogs before the arrival of the Europeans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Savolainen, Thomas Leitner, Alan N. Wilton, Elizabeth Matisoo-Smith, Joakim Lundeberg (Edited by Colin Renfrew)| title=A detailed picture of the origin of the Australian dingo, obtained from the study of mitochondrial DNA|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/33/12387.full.pdf+html| publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States of America|year=2004|accessdate=8 May 2009}}</ref>

European domestic dogs arrived in Australia in the 18th century, the European colonization. Since then, some of those dogs dispersed into the wild (both deliberately and accidentally) and founded feral populations, especially in places where the dingo numbers had been severely reduced due to human intervention. Although there are few records of such releases, their occurrence is supported by reports of free-living dogs of specific breeds being seen or captured in remote areas. The spread of farming and grazing activities in the 19th century led to a further spread of other domestic dogs, both pet and feral ones. Interbreeding with the native dingoes has probably been occurring since the arrival of other domestic dogs in the year 1788.<ref name=""impact""/>

==Causes and forms==
[[File:AustrCattleDogRed wb.jpg|thumb|Red Australian Cattle Dog, a dog breed that was proven to have originated from interbreeding of Australian dingoes and other domestic dogs]]

According to present knowledge, dingoes and other domestic dogs interbreed freely with each other and therefore the term “wild dog” is often used for describing all dingoes, dingo-hybrids and other feral domestic dogs, because the borders between the three are unclear.<ref name=""impact""/>

Interbreeding of dingoes and other domestic dogs is not necessarily unintended and dingoes have been used for the breeding of certain [[dog breed]]s. These breeding attempts already started in the 19th century. The only attempt to date that was regarded as successful was the breeding of the [[Australian Cattle Dog]]. It is possible that the [[Australian Kelpie]] is descended from dingoes too; however, that has not been proven.

Occasionally claims are made that interbreeding of dingoes and other domestic dogs together with successful rearing of hybrids is a rare phenomenon in the wild due to supposedly radical differences in behaviour and biology and the harshness of the wilderness. However, cases of dogs that came from human households but nonetheless manage to survive on their own (even by active hunting) and to successfully rear pups have been consistently proven.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jeffrey S.

[[File:Vermischung.png|thumb|left|350px|Diagram on interbreeding of dingoes and other domestic dogs (after Corbett 1995a)]]

The rate of interbreeding increases when dingoes come to [[Urban area|urban]] centres, due to the prospect of easily accessible food resources. However, since interactions between dingoes and other feral domestic dogs in the bush differ greatly from those in urban places, so too do the rates of hybridisation. It is known that domestic dogs get lost in the bush time and again. However; it is assumed that the behavioural differences between dingoes and other domestic dogs are big enough to make it difficult for these dogs to be integrated into dingo-society and successfully breed, especially in remote areas. A further spreading of hybrids might hasten the process of interbreeding by reducing behavioural differences. This could partially explain the higher proportion of dingo-hybrids in Southeast Australia.<ref name=""impact""/> The most likely possibility is that the [[Territory (animal)|territorial behaviour]] of established dingo-packs, which keeps away all foreign dogs (dingoes included) and prevents them from breeding, curbs the rate of interbreeding.<ref name=""dilution"">{{cite web|author=Rosslyn Beeby |title=Genetic dilution dogs dingoes |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/environment/genetic-dilution-dogs-dingoes/666292.aspx |publisher=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=13 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415072636/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/environment/genetic-dilution-dogs-dingoes/666292.aspx |archivedate=15 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Dingoes owned by humans as pets are likely to use their owner’s home as a base from which to roam, or are abandoned when they reach adulthood. The result of this pet trend is that contacts between dingoes and other domestic dogs are increasing; because pet dingoes grow up without learning the social behaviours that curb mating and therefore crossbreeding. Many such hybrids are rejected by owners or stray to the bush where they may breed with “pure” dingoes. In addition it is proven that hybrids can appear when dingoes mate with [[livestock guardian dogs]]; interbreeding can even occur with dogs that were acquired by their owners to specifically kill dingoes.<ref name=""cunning"">{{cite web|author=Merryl Parker |title=The Cunning Dingo |url=http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/642_thecunningdingo.pdf |publisher=Animals & Society Institute |year=2007 |accessdate=9 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122147/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/642_thecunningdingo.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

There is currently no evidence that the known measures for the control of dingoes and other wild dogs are effectively able to slow the process of interbreeding. It seems rather to be that these controls hasten the process of interbreeding since it breaks up traditional pack structures and therefore causes some mechanisms of [[population control]] to disappear.<ref name=""dilution""/>

==Degree of interbreeding==
Dingo-samples that have been collected in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that half of the wild dogs of [[southern Australia]] were dingo-hybrids; analyses from the early 1980s supported the trend of increasing interbreeding. Based on skull features researchers found out that the proportion of “pure” dingoes in the highlands of the Southeast decreased from 49% in the 1960s to 17% in the 1980s.<ref name=""canid""/> During examinations in the year 1985 in Southeast-Australia only 55% of the 407 studied “dingoes” weren’t hybrids. 36% of the dogs were dingo-hybrids and the rest wild dogs of other origin. In the middle of the 1980s the proportion of “pure” dingoes respectively dingo-hybrids in [[Central Australia]] was estimated (based on skull features) to be 97.5% and 2.4%. To the contrary, in Southeast-Australia the estimates were 55.3% respectively 33.92%. It was reasoned from these findings that mixed populations can be expected in areas were human settlements exist and wild dogs remain, furthermore that hybrids can be expected to be rarer in remote areas. Broken colour-patterns, red with white, black or bluish spots, completely black, brown or bluish, black-and-white and piebald striped patterns were also more prevalent in the second area (34.8%) than in the first (5.7%). In Southeast-Australia there were no differences between areas near farmlands and forest concerning the frequency of the colorations. Many of these colorations also occurred in breeding experiments of reddish dingoes with variously colored other domestic dogs.<ref name=""identity3"">{{cite web|author1=A.E.

This process might have reached such a high extent that there are big populations that consist entirely of hybrids.

Based on skull features there are only a few “pure” dingoes left in New South Wales and the “pure” form might be locally extinct in the highlands of the Southeast.<ref name=""canid"">{{cite web|author=Laurie Corbett| title=Dingo| url=http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf| publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]|work=Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs|year=2004|accessdate= 8 April 2009}}</ref> Even in areas that were once regarded as safe for “pure” dingoes, like the [[Kakadu national park]] or parts of the [[Northern Territory]], dingo-hybrids now exist respectively appear on the border zones of bush and settlements.

However, these hybrids don’t necessarily have to be of low dingo-content.

==Identification of dingo-hybrids==
There are a couple of external features that can be used to distinguish “pure” dingoes from other “pure” domestic dogs. However this might not be the case when concerning mixed-breed dogs and especially dingo-hybrids.

===Distinguishing characteristics===
Dingo-like domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids can be generally distinguished from “pure” dingoes because of coat colour, since they have a wider range of colours and patterns than dingoes. However, even among “pure” dingoes, there is a wide variation of colours. According to the Australian Museum, a dingo's coat colour is largely determined by the area it inhabits. Generally, the coat colour is ginger with white feet. In the desert, dingoes are more golden yellow while in forested and bush areas they are a darker tan to black.<ref>{{cite web|author=Australian Museum|title=Dingo|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Dingo}}</ref> Also reports by early settlers in the Blue Mountains region of NSW described dingoes which had wide variations in coat colours.<ref>{{cite web|author=Catalyst|title=Dingo Secrets|url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/2589671.htm}}</ref> Additionally the dog-typical form of barking appears among dingo-hybrids.
[[File:Dingo or maybe crossbreed.jpg|thumb|right|Although dingo-like, this wild dog has an atypical coloration and is therefore most likely a dingo-crossbreed]]

At the end of the 1970s it was found out that the skulls of dingoes can be distinguished from those of other domestic dogs based on alveolar distance along lower premolars, maxillary width, bulla volume, crown width of upper carnassial tooth, basal length of upper canine and width of [[nasal bone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=A.E. Newsome |author2=Laure Corbett |author3=S.M. Carpenter | title=The Identity of the Dingo I. Morphological Discriminants of Dingo and Dog Skulls.|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO9800615.htm|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=15 December 2008}}</ref> 
To determine the possibility of dingo-hybrids in the wild, hybrids were bred in captivity in the 1970s and the start of the 1980s. Thereby differences in skull features were all the bigger the nearer the hybrid was genetically to other domestic dogs. Even a non-dingo content of about 25% to 12.5% lead to a significant difference when compared to the 8 dingo parents.<ref>{{cite web|author1=A.E. Newsome |author2=Laurie Corbett | title=The Identity of the Dingo II.* Hybridization with Domestic Dogs in Captivity and in the Wild Australian|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/ZO9820365.htm|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=15 December 2008}}</ref>
Unlike dingoes other feral domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids are theoretically capable two come in heat twice annually and tend to have a breeding cycle less influenced by the seasons. However, it is considered to be unlikely that they are capable of rearing two litters per year in the wild since this would require much time and energy. Successful rearing of two successive litters would probably only be possible in the wild under very favourable conditions<ref name=""impact""/> and there is currently no proof that it ever happened in the wild.<ref name=""dilution""/>

During observation at the start of the 1990s captive hybrids did not show the same breeding pattern like “pure” dingoes and many [[testicle]]-parameters did not show the same seasonal variations. Furthermore, they had bigger litters and some were able to reproduce over the whole year. Concerning the duration of the pregnancy there was no evidence for any differences.<ref>{{cite web|author1=P.C. Catling |author2=Laurie Corbett |author3=A.E. Newsome | title=Reproduction in captive and wild dingoes (Canis familiaris dingo) in temperate and arid environments of Australia|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR9920195.htm|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=20 December 2008}}</ref>

Although hybrids may have a weight up to 60&nbsp;kg (supposedly even up to 70&nbsp;kg<ref name=""LoomExtinction""/>), most hybrids do not weigh more than 20&nbsp;kg, which is considered to be within the normal range for dingoes.<ref name=""canid""/> Furthermore, during breeding-experiments there could be no differences in growth patterns of dingoes and similar sized crossbreeds found.<ref>{{cite web|author1=P.C. Catling |author2=Laurie Corbett |author3=M. Westcott | title=Age Determination in the Dingo and Crossbreeds.|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/WR9910075.htm|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref> Additionally, the average age of wild living domestic dogs in Australia is also not higher than what is considered normal for dingoes.<ref name=""impact""/>

A [[genetic discrimination]] is possible but difficult, since there are only a few genetic characteristics that differentiate dingoes from other domestic dogs. A couple of years ago,{{when|date=September 2014}} some scientists from the [[University of New South Wales]] developed a relatively reliable method with 20 genetic “fingerprints” using DNA from skin and blood samples to determine the “purity” of a dingo.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} If one of these “fingerprints” would be found, this would indicate that the examined dog is possibly a hybrid and not a “pure” dingo. The reference group for this test was a group of captive dingoes, thought to cover the whole range of the dingo population. Samples that lay outside of this range would be regarded as hybrids. With increasing development this method might be possible to use on hair and scat samples and provide more exact results.

===Problems with identification===
Despite all the characteristics that may be used to differentiate a dingo from other domestic dogs, there are several problems.

There is no clarity on the subject from which point on a dog is considered a “pure” dingo. There are conflicting opinions in literature on what defines a dingo. The following problems occurred frequently:
* Geographic variations in the [[allometry]] of dingo skulls were not taken into account, when dingoes from Central Australia were used as standard for the “purity” of dingoes.
* Genetic variations of dingoes in captivity were not taken into account, when the [[genetic marker]]s for “purity” were selected
* Methods for the collection of samples, to determine a dingo via [[genetic testing]], are susceptible for flaws in the identification (e.g. mistakes during collecting of the samples)
* [[Microsatellite (genetics)|Microsatellite]]s have been used to determine the “purity”; however an examination of microsatellite data indicated that they are only useful for making conclusion on relatedness
* New research results show that chemicals can influence the [[gene expression]] and development of the [[neural crest]] during the early stages of the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]
From this data it was reasoned that characteristics of dingoes from geographic isolated areas differ from each other and different populations might not be consistent with common description of a dingo.<ref name=""defpure"">{{cite web|author1=Brad Purcell |author2=Robert Mulley |author3=Robert Close |title=Genetic Characterisation of Dingoes in the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area |url=http://www.invasiveanimals.com/downloads/Final-proceedings-with-cover.pdf |work=14th Australasian Vertebrate Pest Conference |publisher=Invasive Animals CRC |pages=140 |date=10–13 June 2008 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116162534/http://www.invasiveanimals.com/downloads/Final-proceedings-with-cover.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Canis lupus dingo - cleland wildlife park.JPG|thumb|left|Dingo from a wildlife park sporting a heavier build than a ""typical"" dingo]]
No distinguishing characteristic is currently one-hundred-percent reliable. Furthermore, results gained under captive conditions cannot be transferred one-on-one to the situation in the wild, because it is not known which characteristics permanently remain under the conditions of [[natural selection]]. Biology and behaviour of dingoes and other wild dogs are generally considered to be so similar, that it is difficult to discriminate between them. Furthermore, much of the information on dingoes might just as likely apply to any other wild dog in Australia. In addition, the external characteristics of living dingoes cannot always be reliably distinguished from dingo-hybrids; since many hybrids are visually indistinguishable from “pure” dingoes (e.g. hybrids resulting from mating with Australian Cattle Dogs<ref name=""taxonomic"">{{cite web|author1=Amanda E. Elledge |author2=Luke K.-P. Leung |author3=Lee R. Allen |author4=Karen Firestone |author5=Alan N.

Even the colour variations, which are regarded as characteristics of the “pure” dingo, can be a hindrance when identifying hybrids and other domestic dogs, when they show the same colourations. Furthermore, historical records report black dingoes but did not mention black-and-tan ones. This colouration might have been overlooked; if not than this would be another feature of hybrids.<ref name=""identity3""/> During breeding experiments with dingoes and other domestic dogs, dogs were born that could not be distinguished from dingoes based on external features but had two heat-cycles annually even down to the third and fourth generation.<ref name=""broadcast""/> In the case of skull features there is the problem that they don’t discriminate between the different degrees of dingo-content in the hybrids, are less and less effective the further the hybrid is genetically away from other domestic dogs and can only be used on already dead specimen. Methods like X-ray and CAT-Scans are possible, but impractical. Also signs of dingo attacks on livestock aren’t reliable as a distinguishing characteristic, since the attack methods and the success rate possible depends the most from the experience and motivation of the attacker and the reactions of the prey.<ref>{{cite web| title=Recognising wild dog and dingo predation|url=http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/vp/ddf/f12400.pdf| publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food|accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref>

Although genetic testing can theoretically determine whether an individual is a hybrid, “pure” dingo or another domestic dog, mistakes in results cannot be excluded. To get reliable data from genetic testing, suitable and sufficient [[genetic material]] from the period before the European colonization should be available for comparison, which is currently not the case.<ref name=""taxonomic""/> Even genetic testing is less effective, the further away the non-dingo is in the dog's ancestry and it is possible that the hybrid had not inherited any genes which were ascribed to other domestic dogs during examinations. Furthermore, even in the case of a “pure” dingo, genetic testing might show results that were not present in the used reference group.

Besides, the different methods for identification of hybrids (DNA, skull features and fur colour) can lead to different results that might be in conflict with each other. During the before-mentioned analysis of 56 wild dogs in southeast Queensland, there was 17.9% conformity between the three used methods for determine the “purity”. The conformity between DNA and skull features was lowest. During this a hitherto unknown form of the “pure” dingo was discovered (based on DNA and skull features): a white dog with orange spots on the fur.

Howling is considered normal for all wild dogs of Australia.<ref name=""impact""/> Hybrids as well as other domestic dogs have been observed in tight pack structures<ref name=""Pizza""/> and free-ranging domestic dogs in Southeast-Australia have been observed hunting and foraging in groups. Free-ranging dogs in Victoria were generally observed in pairs (54%) or alone (34%), with packs of three to seven dogs in 12% of the sightings. Furthermore, there are also reports of dingoes with more than average size and weight and cases where hybrids were successfully used as working and companion dogs<ref name=""dilution2""/> and the Australian Cattle Dog was proven to have dingo ancestors. A generally higher aggression of hybrids could not be confirmed by owners, who worked with respectively investigated them; furthermore hitherto observations and encounters with hybrids in the wild did not reveal any evidence, that hybrids are generally more aggressive than “pure” dingoes.<ref name=""dilution""/>

==Importance and effect of interbreeding==
Interbreeding with other domestic dogs is regarded as the greatest threat to the survival of the “pure” dingo. Genetic analyses, observations and skull measurements over the course of several years strongly indicate that in approximately 50 years the “pure” dingo will have disappeared in the wilderness of the continent and that it is no longer possible to preserve them there.<ref name=""dilution2""/> The dingo researcher Laurie Corbett considers that, given the current rate of interbreeding, there will be no more “pure” dingoes in the wilderness of Victoria in 20 years.<ref name=""broadcast""/> The president of the Dingo Conservation Association Barry Oakman was in an interview in the year 2003 of the opinion that without appropriate measures the “pure” dingo would be extinct in the wild in 30 years, in New South Wales possibly in less than 10 years.<ref name=""oakman1""/> According to other statements the “pure” dingoes are either close to extinction or they will be close to it over the course of the next 20 years.<ref name=""disappear""/> It is assumed that, should the process go on unhindered, the increasing number of genes from other domestic dogs will effectively lead to the extinction on the Australian continent of the dingo as a separate subspecies by 2100 and that the dog population will then consist of hybrids and other feral dogs.<ref name=""impact""/>

===Opinions about this phenomenon===
Fear of interbreeding of dingoes with other domestic dogs is no phenomenon of the last years and already led to a ban on the import of [[German Shepherd Dog]]s to Australia by the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1929. It was feared that the German Shepherds (partly due to the old name “Alsatian Wolfdog”) would be a danger to sheep, become friendly with dingoes and possibly interbreed with them. This ban was first relaxed in 1972 and repealed in 1974.<ref>{{cite web| title=The History of the German Shepherd Dog in Australia|url=http://www.gsdcqld.org.au/The.German.Shepherd.Dog.In.Australia.htm| publisher=The German Shepherd Dog Club of Queensland|accessdate= 2 March 2009}}</ref>

This phenomenon is a problem for some people and for others not. In the scientific area there two main positions concerning the process of interbreeding:

* The “pure” dingo should be preserved
* Populations of wild dogs should be preserved, no matter whether they are hybrids or not.

The first position is probably the most common one. It means that the “pure” dingo should be preserved via strong control measures and only “pure” or mostly “pure” dingoes should get protection.

The second position is relatively new and was first officially stated by Laurie Corbett and Mike J. Daniels. They represented the opinion that dingoes have changed and that it is not possible to bring the “pure” dingo back. Furthermore, historical definitions and the protective legislation based on them, have been rendered “obsolete” by anthropogenic environmental change. Thus interbreeding only means that the dingo today exists in a different form than its ancestors<ref name=""wilddog"">{{cite web|author1=Mike J. Daniels |author2=Laurie Corbett | title=Redefining introgressed protected mammals: when is a wildcat a wild cat and a dingo a wild dog?|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?paper=WR02045|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|accessdate=29 December 2008}}</ref> - some researchers now use the term ''evolving dingo''.<ref name=""dilution""/> Protection for these dogs should be based on how and where they live, as well as on their cultural and ecological importance, instead of concentrating on precise definitions or concerns about genetic “purity”. This approach was generally agreed to, but also hinted that it would be difficult to prove that a species shapes its environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak| title=Wildcats and dingoes 'not worth protecting'|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4029|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=9 August 2003|accessdate=17 January 2009}}</ref> Essentially the genetic integrity of the dingo is already lost due to interbreeding; however, the importance of this phenomenon is disputable according to Corbett and Daniels, since the genes come from a domesticated version of the same species.<ref name=""wilddog""/>

This view point is rejected or at least controversially discussed by those who want to preserve the “pure” dingo. Here for instance the [[Molecular biology|molecular biologist]] Alan Wilton from the University of New South Wales argues that a maximizing of the “genetic purity” is an essential aspect of the dingo conservation.<ref name=""dilution2""/> Dingo-hybrids would supposedly increase the predation on [[native species]], because they would have more litters per year and therefore would have to raise more pups and some of them would be bigger than the average dingo.<ref name=""going""/> He also argued that it is, for instance, not sufficient to regard a wild dog with a little non-dingo-content as a “pure” dingo if it more or less acts the same way. Wilton was of the opinion that the scale had to be set higher when “pure” dingoes are available.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lisa Clausen| title=Dingo, Going, Gone?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1135478,00.html| publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date=28 November 2005|accessdate=15 February 2009}}</ref> Corbett and Daniels agreed that it is practical and desirable to minimize the effect of other domestic dog genes. By this it would first be possible to find areas were the process is slower and to be able to limit it later; and second the populations would be able to develop accordingly to their [[natural environment]]. Furthermore, hybrids and other feral domestic dogs would probably not have the same tourist effect, because they don’t correspond with the current expectations on wild dingoes.<ref name=""wilddog""/>

To label this process, apart from the word interbreeding/hybridization, also terms like dilution<ref name=""dilution2""/> of the dingoes or weakening of the genetic line<ref name=""wilddogs/dingo"">{{cite web|title=Queensland Pest ANimal Strategies - Wild dogs/dingo Canis familiaris/Canis familiaris (dingo) |url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |publisher=Department of Employment, Economic Development & Industries |date=September 2002 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531220438/http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> are in usage. Even in the scientific area the process was called a sort of ''[[genetic pollution]]''<ref name=""disappear""/> (itself a controversial term<ref>{{cite web|title=What’s Wrong with the Environmental Movement: an interview with Patrick Moore|url=http://www.heartland.org/policybot/results.html?artId=14035|publisher=The Heartland Institute|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=J.M.

A demand for control of this process is based on the principle of caution and effective control measures are regarded as necessary. However this faces problems that are not negligible. To separate the “pure” dingo from other domestic dogs is difficult, if it is possible at all. The costs would be enormous, and even if all hybrids are destroyed, there are currently no methods to tests the dingoes in the field. Furthermore, control measures usually do not discriminate between dingoes and other domestic dogs. According to the biologist David Jenkins from the [[Australian National University]] there is little that can be done to reverse the process of interbreeding. Even if selectively searching for hybrids during the killings, it would only disrupt the pack structure and therefore affect the breeding rate of the dogs.<ref name=""dilution""/>

===Possible changes in behaviour and biology===
The exact effect of domestic dogs from human households on the social structure of free living dogs in Australia is not well documented. However, it is regarded as likely that the same factors, that influence the social organization of dingoes in different areas also influence the social behaviour other feral domestic dogs and dingo-hybrids.<ref name=""impact""/>

The biology and ecology of dingo-hybrids has only been insufficiently researched, because most studies were limited on the topic of controlling these dogs.<ref name=""Blue2005"">{{cite web|author1=Brad V. Purcell |author2=Robert Mulley |author3=Robert Close |author4=Jason Flesch |title=Prey Activity As An Indicator of Prey Selection By a Free-Ranging Population of Wild Canids in New South Wales|url=http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/meetings/carnivores_2006_petersburg.pdf|work=Carnivores| publisher=Carnivore Ecology & Conservation|pages=52|date=12–15 November 2006|accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref> However, some changes in the wild dog population could be observed.

[[File:Uluru dingo.jpg|thumb|left|A dog at [[Uluru]] with visible characteristics of other dog-lines.]]
It is proven that there is a much wider range of fur colours, skull features and body sizes among the modern day wild dog population than in the times before the European colonization. Within Queensland for instance the different dog populations vary significantly, depending on the extent of interbreeding, while a bigger diversity of characteristics led to classification problems in Victoria and the term “wild dog” is now often used to label the current dog population. Evidence from south-eastern populations of Australian wild dogs indicates that the regular breeding rhythm of the dingo is interrupted, when a high number of dingo-hybrids and other domestic dogs, exists.

According to a five-year study of 2000 wild dogs from all states of Australia by Ricky Spencer from the [[University of Western Sydney]] some populations consist to 80% of dingo-hybrids and this ''enrichment'' of genes has provided a catalyst for the selection and [[Microevolution|micro-evolution]] of bigger wild dogs.<ref>{{cite web| title=Wild dogs getting bigger, more mixed|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/19/2279568.htm|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] News|accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref> Over the course of the last 40 years there was an increase of the average wild dog body mass of about 20%, with 40% of the adult wild dogs in the Southeast of the continent now weighing more than 17&nbsp;kg. This larger dog size has led to a higher efficiency with which wild dogs kill major prey and models indicate that a pack of wild dogs today requires almost a quarter more daily energy intake than an average pack of wild dogs prior to 1980.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Ricky-John Spencer |author2=Steven J.

On the topic of possible changes in behaviour did Ricky Spencer commented that it is not predictable how the interbreeding will affect the behaviour of the dingoes; he assumed that there could be potential problems since supposedly only dingoes are not accustomed to humans.<ref name=""disappear""/> According to David Jenkins, the claims stating that hybrids are bigger, more aggressive and a risk to public safety have so far not been supported by data and personal experience. He mentioned that there are reports of one or two unusually big dogs captured each year, but that most hybrids are close to what's considered to be the normal weight range of dingoes. In addition, Jenkins has encountered wild dingoes and hybrids and reported that ""there's something really going on in that hard-wired brain"", but also that the dogs ""tend to be curious, rather than aggressive.""<ref name=""dilution""/>

Most attacks of wild dogs on livestock are supposedly caused by dingo-hybrids and not “pure” dingoes,<ref name=""oakman1"">{{cite news| title=Australia’s dingo dogs face extinction|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-10-07-dongos-extinct_x.htm| publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=10 July 2003|accessdate=1 March 2009}}</ref> however the effect of wild dogs on the cattle industry is very variable,<ref>{{cite web|title=A Management Program for the Dingo (Canis lupus dingo) in the Northern Territory of Australia 2006 - 2011 |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/programs/pdf/dingo_management.pdf |publisher=Northern Territory Government |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913072502/http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/programs/pdf/dingo_management.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> generally low (0-10% losses per year)<ref>{{cite web|title=Western Australian Wild Dog Management Strategy 2005 |url=http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/PW/VP/DDF/FARMERS_SM.PDF |publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia |date=August 2005 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901225952/https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/vp/ddf/farmers_sm.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the majority of the much more susceptible sheep industry is located in the areas south of the [[Dingo fence]], were the majority of the area has no stable wild dog populations and many of the remaining populations tend to have a high number of hybrids.

===Ecological impact===
[[File:Red-Necked Wallaby Back.JPG|thumb|right|A [[red-necked wallaby]], one of the animals proven to be prey for dingoes and dingo-hybrids]]
It is unknown if in the case of the disappearance of the “pure” dingo the then existing hybrids will alter the predation pressure on other species. It is also not clear what kind of place these dogs will have in the Australian ecosystem and research results on this topic are rare. However, it is considered probable that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will not be disturbed by this.<ref name=""impact""/> One example in this topic are the [[bush rat]]s, where it is also seen as unlikely that there could be problems due to the dingo-hybrids, because these rodents had been exposed to the influence of the dingoes for thousands of years.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Axel Strauß |author2=Katrin Y.

During studies on the efficacy of baits with [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] (a deadly poison for [[canis|canids]]) in the Kosciuszko national park in the middle of the 1980s, the local dogs (which were not classified as dingoes) have been observed with home ranges of similar sizes like dingoes from Southeast-Australia. In addition these dogs also showed a preference for living prey, which lessened the efficacy of the baits.<ref>{{cite web|author1=J.C. Mcilroy |author2=R.J. Cooper |author3=E.J. Gifford |author4=B.F.

Similar to “pure” dingoes, these hybrids hunted alone as well as in coordinated packs. The same ecological role was officially reported for the hybrids of the [[Namadgi National Park|Namadgi-national park]] who filled the place of the apex-predator and kept kangaroo-numbers low.<ref>{{cite web|author=Megan Doherty|title=Wild dogs 'stalked bushwalkers'|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/wild-dogs-stalkedbushwalkers/1228179.aspx|publisher=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref>

'''Canine reproduction''' is the process of [[sexual reproduction]] in [[domestic dog]]s.

==Canine sexual anatomy and development==

===General===
In domestic dogs, sexual maturity ([[puberty]]) occurs between the ages of 6 to 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reproductive performance|url=https://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/fulldocs/MONONO5/Reproduc.htm|website=ilri|accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> Pregnancy is possible as soon as the first [[estrus cycle]], but breeding is not recommended prior to the second cycle.<ref name=""breedcycle"">[http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology- 5361/the_normal_canine.htm], Dr B Eilts, Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine, ""Normal Canine Reproduction"" retrieved 10 April 2013</ref> As with other domesticated species, [[domestication]] has selectively bred for higher [[libido]], and earlier and more frequent breeding cycles in dogs than in their ancestors.<ref>[http://vetmedicine.about.com/od/pregnancybirthindogs/f/FAQ_pregdog.htm]</ref>

==The reproductive cycle==

===Female cycle===
The average length of the reproductive cycle for females is 2–4 weeks. Females reach sexual maturity (puberty) between 8 and 18&nbsp;months of age. There is a tremendous variability in the maturation age between breeds, and even within a breed of dog.<ref name=""estrous"">[http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm], Dr B Eilts, LSU Veterinary Medicine, ""The Normal Canine Estrous Cycle"" retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref>

The first stage of the reproductive cycle is proestrus, in which eggs in the ovaries begin to mature and estrogen levels begin to rise. During this stage males are attracted to non-receptive females. Initially, the vulva lips will swell up and become pliable and there will be small amounts of bloody vaginal discharge along with signs of frequent urination and restlessness. Proestrus generally lasts 9 days.<ref name=""estrous"">[http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/the_normal_canine.htm], Dr B Eilts, LSU Veterinary Medicine, ""The Normal Canine Estrous Cycle"" retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref>

Estrus is the next stage, in which estrogen levels are high, mature eggs are released from ovaries, and the females mentally and physically become receptive to [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]]. It is only during estrus that copulation will result in pregnancy.

During proestrus and estrus, females may have a clear to bloody discharge. This stage is also known as ""heat."" The length of these cycles varies greatly between individuals. Proestrus and estrus can last anywhere from 5 days to 21 days.<ref name=""estrous"" />

[[Diestrus]] is the period following mating. Diestrus lasts approximately 56 to 58 days in a pregnant female, and 60 to 100 days in a non-pregnant female. During both of these periods, progesterone levels are high.  Because the hormonal profile of a pregnant female and a female in diestrus are the same, sometimes a non-pregnant female will go through a period of [[false pregnancy|pseudo-pregnancy]].  At that time she may gain weight, have mammary gland development, produce milk, and exhibit nesting behaviours.

Anestrus is the period of reproductive quiescence. The female has no attraction to or from the male. Anestrus generally lasts four to five months.<ref name=""estrous"" />

==Copulation==

As with most [[tetrapod]]s, canine [[animal sexual behavior|copulation]] involves the male mounting the female from behind, a position that is referred to as ""[[doggy style]]"" but does not have a specifically known origin.

When the penis is locked into the vagina by the bulbus glandis (when the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] is ""tied""), thrusting behavior stops and the male will usually lift a leg and swing it over the female's back while turning around.

==Gestation and litters==
[[File:Pregnant bitch mongrel Jan 2008 Shot in Jalandhar Punjab India by gopal1035 017.jpg|thumb|right|A pregnant [[Mixed-breed dog|mongrel]]]][[File:Wilde huendin am stillen.jpg|thumb|right|A wild dog from Sri Lanka nursing her puppies.]]
Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation. Since it is difficult to determine the exact date of ovulation, errors are often made in calculating gestation period.<ref name=""gestation"">[http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/eiltslotus/theriogenology-5361/canine_pregnancy.htm], Dr B Eilts, Louisiana State University Veterinary Medicine, ""Canine Pregnancy"" retrieved 10 April 2013.</ref> Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days <ref name=""sperm sequestration"">[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432000001305], M.A. Scott, Department of Population Health and Reproduction, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, ""A glimpse at sperm function in vivo: sperm

If she is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long.

A rule of thumb is that a mammal will produce half as many offspring as the number of teats on the mother.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} This rule is altered in domesticated animals since larger litters are often favoured for economic reasons and in dogs, particularly, the great range of sizes and shapes plays a role in how many healthy puppies a female can carry.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} A female dog usually has 10 teats, though this does not mean she can necessarily provide sufficient nutrition for 10 puppies in one litter.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An average litter consists of about five to six [[puppy|puppies]], though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. Size of the breed is correlated with litter size. Miniature and small breeds average three to four puppies in each litter, with a maximum litter size of about 5-8. Large and giant breeds average 7 puppies per litter but can have a maximum litter size of about 15.<ref name=""Borge"">{{cite journal|last1=Borge|first1=K. S.|last2=Tønnessen|first2=R.|last3=Nødtvedt|first3=A.|last4=Indrebø|first4=A.|title=Litter size at birth in purebred dogs—A retrospective study of 224 breeds|journal=Theriogenology|date=March 2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=911–919|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.034|pmid=21196028}}</ref> In one study, the [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]] had the highest average litter size with 8.9 pups per litter while the Pomeranian and Toy Poodle had the lowest with 2.4 pups per litter.<ref name=""Borge""/>

The number of puppies also varies with the mother's age. In smaller breeds, both young and old age are associated with smaller litter size. In larger breeds, only old age is associated with smaller litter size.<ref name=""Borge""/> Use of artificial insemination is also associated with smaller litter size, with frozen semen having a stronger effect than fresh semen.<ref name=""Borge""/>

The largest litter size to date was set by a Napoleon Bull Mastiff in Manea, Cambridgeshire, UK on November 29, 2004; the litter was 24 puppies.<ref>http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-litter-dog/</ref>

Some breeds have been developed to emphasize certain physical traits beyond the point at which they can safely bear litters on their own.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A large scale study in Norway showed that across all breeds, about 4% of pups will be stillborn and a further 4% will die within the first week (early neonatal mortality). Between 8 days and 8 weeks, 1% will die. Litter size, breed size and age of the female is associated with increased risk. High risk breeds for stillborn includes the Dogue de Bordeaux (14.2%), St. Bernard (12.3%), Chow Chow (12.1%), Pembroke Welsh Corgis (11.7%) and Dalmatian (10.6%). The Basenji, Italian Greyhound, Australian Terrier, Irish Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier and the Bichon Havanaise had few to no stillborns (0-0.6%). High risk breeds for early neonatal mortality includes the Rhodesian Ridgeback (11.6%), Dogue de Bordeaux (10.4% ), Dalmatians (8.8%) and Icelandic Sheepdog (8.7%) while the Basenji and Tibetan Terrier had no early neonatal mortality and the Border Terrier and Danish-Swedish Farmdog had <1% early neonatal mortality.<ref name=""Canine perinatal mortality"">{{cite journal|last1=Tønnessen|first1=R.|last2=Borge|first2=K.

Common causes of early neonatal mortality are bacteria infection, fetal asphyxia and fading puppy syndrome. Other causes may include elective euthanasia because of congenital defects or failure to meet [[breed standards]].<ref name=""Canine perinatal mortality""/>

Other multi-breed studies have put stillborn rates at 6.5-7% and early neonatal mortality at 11.5-19.8%.<ref name=""Canine perinatal mortality""/>

===Inbreeding depression===

On the basis of an analysis of data on 42,855 [[dachshund]] litters, it was found that as the [[Coefficient of relationship|inbreeding coefficient]] increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating [[inbreeding depression]].<ref name=""pmid15803761"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gresky C, Hamann H, Distl O |title=[Influence of inbreeding on litter size and the proportion of stillborn puppies in dachshunds] |language=German |journal=Berl.

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Because the [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') largely exists in fragmented small populations, its existence is endangered.  [[Inbreeding avoidance]] via mate selection is characteristic of the species and has important potential consequences for population persistence.<ref name=Becker>{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker PA, Miller PS, Gunther MS, Somers MJ, Wildt DE, Maldonado JE |title=Inbreeding avoidance influences the viability of reintroduced populations of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e37181 |year=2012 |pmid=22615933 |pmc=3353914 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037181 |url=}}</ref>  Inbreeding is rare within natal packs.  Computer-population simulations indicate that all populations continuing to avoid incestuous mating will become extinct within 100 years due to the unavailability of unrelated mates.<ref name=Becker />  Thus the impact of reduced numbers of suitable unrelated mates will likely have a severe demographic impact on the future viability of small wild dog populations.

[[Red wolf|Red wolves]] primarily live in packs composed of a socially [[Monogamy|monogamous]] breeding pair and offspring of different ages.  Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare.<ref name=Sparkman>Sparkman AM, Adams JR, Steury TD, Waits, LP, Murray DL. Pack social dynamics and inbreeding avoidance in the cooperatively breeding red wolf.  Behavioral Ecology. 2012 July; 23(6):1186-1194. doi:10.1093/beheco/ars099</ref>  A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation.<ref name=Sparkman />

Among [[Ethiopian wolf|Ethiopian wolves]], most females disperse from their natal pack at about two years of age, and some become ""floaters"" that may successfully immigrate into existing packs.  Breeding pairs are most often unrelated to each other, suggesting that female-biased dispersal reduces inbreeding.<ref>Randall DA, Pollinger JP, Wayne RK, Tallents LA, Johnson PJ, Macdonald DW. Inbreeding is reduced by female-biased dispersal and mating behavior in Ethiopian wolves.   Behavioral Ecology. 2007;18(3):579-89. doi:10.1093/beheco/arm010</ref>

Grey wolves and Arctic foxes also exhibit [[inbreeding avoidance]].<ref name=""pmid22077191"">{{cite journal |vauthors=Geffen E, Kam M, Hefner R, Hersteinsson P, Angerbjörn A, Dalèn L, Fuglei E, Norèn K, Adams JR, Vucetich J, Meier TJ, Mech LD, Vonholdt BM, Stahler DR, Wayne RK |title=Kin encounter rate and inbreeding avoidance in canids |journal=Mol.

An [[artificial vagina]] is prepared, which is a conical thin latex sleeve ending in a sterile collection tube. The inside of the latex sleeve is lightly lubricated.

==Cross breeding==
Designer breed dogs are [[Mixed-breed dogs]] that are intentionally bred from parents of two established breeds.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Studies have shown that cross-bred dogs have a number of desirable reproductive traits.  Scott and Fuller<ref name=""scott"">{{cite book|title=Dog Behavior|author1=John Paul Scott |author2=John L. Fuller }}</ref> found that cross-bred dogs were superior mothers compared to purebred mothers, producing more milk and giving better care.  These advantages led to a decreased mortality in the offspring of cross-bred dogs; however, the qualities of cross bred dogs are not predictable.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  For example, Labrador x Poodle (""[[Labradoodle]]"") can inherit the coat of either a Labrador, a poodle, or a remix.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Spaying and neutering==
{{Main article|Neutering}}
Spaying (females) and castrating (males) refers to the [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] of animals—usually by removal of the male's [[testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]]—to eliminate the ability to procreate, and reduce [[sex drive]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Castration has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs(in some cases), but spaying has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Heidenberger E, Unshelm J |title=[Changes in the behavior of dogs after castration]|language=German|journal=Tierärztliche Praxis|volume=18|issue=1|pages=69–75|year=1990|pmid=2326799|doi=}}</ref>

{{anchor|Altered Females}}
'''Altered Females:'''

Increased aggression can be shown in altered females if they have previously displayed aggression prior to surgical alteration. In a study by O'Farrell and Peachy, female dogs less than 11 months of age that had previously shown signs of aggression are more likely to have an increase in aggression after being spayed.<ref name= ""Beaver1999"">{{cite journal|author=Bonnie Beaver|title=Canine Behavior: A Guide for Veterinarians|year=1999}}</ref> These increases in aggression may be due to the sudden change in hormone concentrations that are the result of alteration. While spaying female dogs does not ""induce"" aggression, it can increase aggression and facilitate indiscriminate appetite in young altered females and can include them rapidly eating meals or eating food-associated items such as trash.<ref name=""Beaver1999""/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Peter Borchelt|title=Aggressive Behavior of dogs kept as companion animals: Classification and influence of sex, reproductive status and breed|journal=Applied Animal Ethology|volume=10|issue=1 & 2|pages=45–61|year=1983|doi=10.1016/0304-3762(83)90111-6}}</ref>

'''Altered males:'''

In nearly 2/3 of the cases that involve inter-dog aggression, castration can help decrease aggression. Castration also decreases other male-typical behavioral traits such as mounting, roaming, and urine marking. But a few studies have shown that male behavioral issues of mounting, roaming and urine marking still exist in altered males.  Some people have reported after altering their male dogs that behavior such as roaming, mounting and urine marking has not changed the behavior.  Aggression may increase, as the decrease in testosterone may lead to emotional issues and become more likely to react aggressively when feeling under threat.<ref>http://www.apbc.org.uk/articles/neuteringmaledogs</ref> Male puppies that are neutered between 7 and 10 weeks are three times less likely to display behavioral problems, compared to canines neutered at 6 months or older.<ref name= ""O'Farrel1990"">{{cite journal|author1=V.

Removing testosterone can decrease the intensity of a canine's reaction to stimulus. Testosterone does not cause a behavior to occur, but its absence may decrease the occurrence of a ""bad"" behavior.<ref name=""O'Farrel1990""/>

[[File:Dogo1.jpg|thumb|A [[Guatemalan Dogo]] with cropped ears]]'''Cropping''' is the removal of part or all of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] or auricles, the external visible flap of the ear, of an animal; it sometimes involves taping to make the ears pointy.  Most commonly performed on dogs, it is an ancient practice that was once done for perceived health, practical or cosmetic reasons. In modern times, it is banned in many nations, but is still legal in a limited number of countries. Where permitted, it is seen only in certain breeds of dog such as the [[Pit bull]], [[Miniature Pinscher]], [[Doberman Pinscher]], [[Schnauzer]], [[Great Dane]], [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]], [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] and [[Beauceron]].

The veterinary procedure is known as cosmetic otoplasty. Current veterinary science provides no medical or physical advantage to the animal from the procedure,<ref name=slatter>Slatter, Douglas H. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_nh6zSr4wUC ''Textbook of small animal surgery''] 3rd edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders (imprint of Elsevier Health Sciences), 2896 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7216-8607-3}}, p.1746</ref><ref name=petmd>{{cite web|publisher=Pet MD|url=http://www.petmd.com/dog/care/evr_dg_ear_cropping_is_it_right_for_your_dog|title=Ear Cropping: Is it right for your dog?}}</ref> leading to concerns over [[animal cruelty]] related to performing unnecessary surgery on the animals. In addition to the bans in place in countries around the world, it is described in some veterinary texts as ""no longer considered ethical.""<ref name=slatter/>

Cropping of large portions of the pinnae of other animals is rare, although the clipping of identifying shapes in the pinnae of [[livestock]], called [[Earmark (agriculture)|earmark]]s, was common prior to the introduction of compulsory [[ear tag]]s.<ref name=manade>[http://www.manade-en-camargue.fr/manade-en-camargue-lexique.html Lexique Camarguais] (in French) Manade Devaux. ""Lexicon of Camargue terms"" Accessed September 2011</ref>  Removal of portions of the ear of [[laboratory mice]] for identification, i.e. ear-notching, is still used.  The practice of cropping for cosmetic purposes is rare in non-canines, although some selectively bred animals have naturally small ears which can be mistaken for cropping.

==History and purposes==

Ear cropping has been performed on dogs since [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] times.<ref name=Broughton>Broughton, Amy L. (2003) [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/dduscroppingdocking.htm#V Cropping and Docking: A Discussion of the Controversy and the Role of Law in Preventing Unnecessary Cosmetic Surgery on Dogs] Michigan State University - Detroit College of Law. Accessed September 2011.</ref>

=== Traditional cropping ===
Historically, cropping was performed on working dogs in order to decrease the risk of health complications, such as ear infections or hematomas. Crops were also performed on dogs that might need to fight, either while hunting animals that might fight back or while defending [[livestock]] herds from predators, or because they were used for pit-fighting sports such as [[dogfighting]] or [[bear-baiting]].<ref name=Briar/><ref name=murgai>Murgai, Major R.P. (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPPTZvzNNHMC ''Handbook on Dogs''] New Delhi: New Age International, p.46</ref>  The ears were an easy target for an opposing animal to grab or tear.<ref name=Briar>[http://www.briarleabouvier.com/ear_cropping.htm Ear Cropping: Correct or Cruel?] Briarlea Bouvier Kennel. Accessed September 2011.</ref>

Cropping the ears of [[livestock guardian dogs]] was, and may still be, traditional in some pastoral cultures. The ears of working flock-defense dogs such as the [[Caucasian Shepherd Dog]] (Kavkazskaïa Ovtcharka)<ref name=kavk>Samsonova, Anna [http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/328g02-en.doc Caucasian Shepherd Dog (Kavkazskaïa Ovtcharka)] Fédération Cynologique Internationale FCI-Standard N° 328, 2 February 2011. Accessed September 2011</ref> and the [[Maremma Sheepdog|Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese]] were traditionally cropped to reduce the possibility of wolves or aggressor dogs getting a hold on them.<ref name=breber>Breber, Paolo (1983) ''Il Cane da Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese'' (in Italian) 2nd edition. Firenze: Olimpia ""The Maremmano-Abruzzese shepherd dog"" pp.98–99</ref> According to one description, cropping was carried out when puppies were weaned, at about six weeks. It was performed by an older or expert shepherd, using the ordinary blade shears used for [[Sheep shearing|shearing]], well sharpened. The ears were cut either to a point like those of a fox, or rounded like those of a bear. The removed auricles were given to the puppy to eat, in the belief that it would make him more ""sour"";<ref name=breber/> the ears were first grilled.<ref name=anne>MacDonell, Anne, Amy Atkinson (ill.) (1907) [https://archive.org/stream/inabruzzi00macdrich#page/n7/mode/2up ''In the Abruzzi''] New York: F.A. Stokes p. 18</ref> An alternative method was to remove the ears from newborn puppies by twisting them off; however, this left almost no external ear on the dog.<ref name=breber/>  More than three hundred years ago, both ear-cropping and the use of [[Wolf collar|spiked collars]] were described as a defense against wolves by [[Jean de la Fontaine]] in Fable 9 of Book X of the ''Fables'', published in 1678.<ref name=wright>Wright, Elizur (trans.), Jean de la Fontaine (1862) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSEvJ41PpMC ''The fables of La Fontaine, translated [in verse&#93; from the French''] London: Miller p.74</ref>

Dogs may have their ears cropped, legally or not, for participation in dogfights, themselves illegal in many jurisdictions.<ref name=curtis>Curtis, Patricia (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0ndd3eAnzpcC ''City dog: choosing and living well with a dog in town''] New York: Lantern Books {{ISBN|978-1-59056-000-6}} p.37</ref>

=== Health benefits ===

Historically, ear cropping has been advocated as a health benefit for certain breeds with long, hanging ears. There is some evidence that dogs with standing ears may suffer from fewer ear infections than dogs with hanging ears.<ref name=Briar/><ref>Fossum TW. Surgery of the ear. In: Fossum TW, ed. Small Animal Surgery. 3rd ed. St.Louis; Mosby Elsevier, 2007;289-316.</ref> It has also been hypothesized that standing ears are less prone to damage and subsequent medical complications, especially in working dogs. Some claim that cropped ears enhance Boxers' hearing.<ref name=Boxer>{{cite web|author=Abraham, S.|year=1993|url=http://americanboxerclub.org/Gazette/gaz93-01.pdf|publisher=American Kennel Club Gazette, American Boxer Club|accessdate=January 18, 2016|title=Sad lesson learned}}</ref>  Long, hanging ears can not function the same way as erect ears which can swivel toward a sound source.  The erect shape directs sound waves into the [[ear canal]] and additionally amplifies the sound slightly.  Long, hanging [[Auricle (anatomy)|pinnae]] also impose a physical barrier to sound waves entering the ear canal.<ref>

</ref>

=== Cosmetic cropping ===
[[File:Boxer (dog).jpg|thumb|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] with natural and cropped ears and docked tails]]
In the last 100 years or so, ear cropping has been performed more often for cosmetic purposes.<ref name=murgai/><ref name=CFHS/> In nations and states where it remains legal, it is usually practiced because it is required as part of a breed standard for exhibition at [[Conformation show|dog shows]].<ref name=CFHS>[http://cfhs.ca/athome/ear_cropping_and_tail_docking Ear cropping and tail docking] The Canadian Federation of Humane Societies/Fédération des sociétés canadiennes d'assistance aux animaux (CFHS/FSCAA). Accessed September 2011.</ref>
 	
[[File:Dobermann_puppy.jpg|thumb|A [[Doberman Pinscher]] puppy with its ears taped to train them into the desired shape and carriage after cropping]]

The veterinary procedure is known as ""cosmetic otoplasty"".<ref name=""slatter""/> It is usually performed on puppies at 7 to 12 weeks of age.<ref name=doggies>[http://www.doggiesparadise.com/earcropping-dogs.shtml Practice of Dogs Ear cropping] [sic] Doggie's Paradise. Accessed September 2011</ref>  After 16 weeks, the procedure is more painful and the animal has greater pain memory.<ref name=Briar/> Up to 2/3 of the ear flap may be removed in a cropping operation, and the wound edges are closed with stitches. The ears are then bandaged and taped until they heal into the proper shape.<ref name=doggies/> The procedure is recommended to be undertaken under general anaesthesia; opponents' primary concerns revolve around post-operative pain.<ref>https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Documents/dogs_ear_cropping_bgnd.pdf</ref>

American veterinary schools do not generally teach cropping and docking, and thus veterinarians who perform the practice have to learn on the job.<ref name=Broughton/> There are also problems with amateurs performing ear-cropping, particularly at [[puppy mill]]s.<ref name=Broughton/>  

In the USA, although [[docking (dog)|tail-docking]], [[dewclaw|dewclaw removal]], and [[neutering]] procedures remain common, ear-cropping is declining, save within the dog show industry.<ref name=CFHS/> However, many show ring competitors state they would discontinue the practice altogether if they could still ""win in the ring.""<ref name=USAtoday>Weise, Elizabeth [http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2009-07-30-dog-tails_N.htm 'Banfield pet hospitals ban tail docking, ear cropping on dogs'] ''USA Today'', 30 July 2011. Accessed September 2011.</ref>

[http://www.stopthecrops.com/ K-I-S-S Guide to Living with a Dog] Stop the Crops.

Ear-cropping is still widely practiced in the United States and parts of Canada, with approximately 130,000 puppies in the United States thought to have their ears cropped each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/articles/dduscroppingdocking.htm |title=Cropping and Docking: A Discussion of the Controversy and the Role of Law in Preventing Unnecessary Cosmetic Surgery on Dogs |publisher=Animallaw.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>  The [[American Kennel Club|American]] and [[Canadian Kennel Club]]s both permit the practice.<ref name=CFHS/> The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) position is that ear cropping and tail docking are ""acceptable practices integral to defining and preserving breed character and/or enhancing good health.""<ref>[http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/position_statements.cfm#earcropping Ear Cropping, Tail Docking and Dewclaw Removal] American Kennel Club Canine Legislation Position Statements</ref> While some individual states have attempted to ban ear-cropping,<ref name=NY>{{cite web| url= http://www.akc.org/news/index.cfm?article_id=2908 | title= NEW CALL TO ACTION FOR AMENDED NY STATE CROP/DOCK BILL | publisher= [[American Kennel Club]] | date= 9 June 2006 | accessdate= 2007-12-31}}</ref> there is strong opposition from some dog breed organizations, who cite health concerns and tradition.<ref name=Boxer/>

While it has been suggested the cropping may interfere with a dog's ability to communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases a dog's ability to communicate with ear signals.

==Naturally small ears==
Some animals, such as the [[American Lamancha goat|Lamancha goat]], have ears which are naturally small as the result of selective breeding, and some people mistakenly believe their ears to be cropped.<ref name=Woods>{{Citation|title=The American Lamancha, and its Ears.|last1=Woods|first1=Dale L.| last2=Hendrickson|first2= Pat |year=1978|publisher=Dairy Goat Journal|url=http://www.lamanchas.com/ears.htm}}</ref><ref>[http://www.goats4h.com/none.html ""What did we do to its ears?""Accessed September 19, 2011.]</ref>

In other animals, small ears may result from a genetic mutation or the emergence of a [[dominance (genetics)|genetically recessive trait]], such as in [[Highland cattle]], where the appearance of small ears, appearing to have their pinnae cropped, is viewed as a defect.<ref>[http://www.cruachan.com.au/bairnsley.htm Crop Ear. what does it look like?] Cruachan Highland Cattle.

'''Pet Check Technology''' is an online [[software]] and [[mobile application]] for [[dog walking]] companies and dog walking customers. Using [[QR codes]], mobile apps, [[e-mail]] alerts and [[GPS tracking]], [http://www.petchecktechnology.com Pet Check Technology] allows customers to see when and where their dogs went with their walkers.<ref>http://dsc.discovery.com/gear-gadgets/pet-check-ensures-you-fido-is-getting-walked.html</ref> Pet Check Technology launched in the [[Los Angeles]] area in August 2011 and has plans to expand to major cities in the upcoming months.<ref name=""FastCo"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1777570/in-the-us-the-qr-code-shouts-im-not-dead-yet</ref>

== About ==
Pet Check Technology was created in 2011 by Doug Simon, founder of [[Chicago]]-based dog walking company, [http://www.walkthedogchicago.com Walk the Dog].<ref>http://www.walkthedogchicago.com/about-us</ref> Pet Check Technology was created by Walk the Dog to ensure that dogs were being walked for the time allotted on the dog walker's schedule.<ref name=""BSun"">http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/pets/unleashed/bal-is-your-dogwalker-cheating-you-20110824,0,2480982.story</ref>

Pet Check Technology provides dog walking companies with online tools for scheduling clients, billing, and tracking dog-walking employees.<ref name=""CNET"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20098849-1/qr-codes-and-gps-track-dog-walking-services/</ref> For customers, Pet Check allows them to see exactly when their dog was taken out for a walk, where they went, and what time they got back.

== How it works ==
The dog walker scans a [[QR code]] with the Pet Check mobile app for [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] when arriving to pick up a dog.<ref name=""Gizmodo"">http://gizmodo.com/5835577/pet-check-stalk-your-dog-and-dog-walker-with-gps</ref> The app displays their schedule as well as any notes (such as number of stops and interaction with other dogs) for customer walk reports.<ref>http://www.petchecktechnology.com/about-us</ref> [[GPS]] tracks the walk and another QR code scan lets the customer know when the walk ends.<ref name=""BSun"" /> Pet Check sends an e-mail alert each time the customer's QR code is scanned. The customer can then watch the walk happen on an [[online map]]. Completed walk reports are stored for future reference. Dog walking companies using Pet Check Technology  have the ability to choose a customer payment method that works best for their business.<ref>http://www.petchecktechnology.com/how-it-works</ref>

'''[[Dog]]s''' (''Canis lupus familiaris''), which are mankind's first and most common [[Domestication|domestic animal]]s, have played a role in many religious traditions.

== Religions and cultures ==
Below entries are arranged in alphabetical order.

=== Aztec religion ===
{{Further|Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth}}
Dogs had a major religious and symbolic significance to the [[Aztec]] peoples of central [[Mexico]]. Several ancient burial sites for dogs have been discovered in Mexico.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ancient-dog-burial-site-found-mexico-city|title=Aztec dog burial site found in Mexico City|author=Olga R. Rodriguez|publisher=Associated Press|date=Feb 14, 2014}}</ref> [[Xolotl]], an Aztec god of death, was depicted as a dog-headed monster.

=== Chinese tradition ===
{{Further|Dog (zodiac)|Dog in Chinese mythology}}
The dog is one of the 12 animals honored in [[Chinese astrology]]. The second day of the [[Chinese New Year]] is considered to be the birthday of all dogs and Chinese people often take care to be kind to dogs on that day. 

=== Christianity ===
[[File:St Rochus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Statue of [[Saint Roch]] with his dog, in [[Prague]], Czech Republic.]]
A dog is mentioned in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Tobit]], faithfully accompanying Tobias, Tobit's son and the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] on their journeys.

[[Jesus]] told the story of the poor man [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus]], whose sores were licked by street dogs. This has traditionally been seen as showing Lazarus's wretched situation.

The [[Catholic Church]] recognizes [[Saint Roch]] (also called Saint Rocco), who lived in the early 14th century in France, as the [[patron saint]] of dogs. It is said that he caught the [[Black Death|plague]] while doing charitable work and went into the forest, expecting to die. There he was befriended by a dog which licked his sores and brought him food, and he was able to recover. The [[feast day]] of Saint Roch, August 16, is celebrated in [[Bolivia]] as the ""birthday of all dogs.""<ref name=""culturalcatholic"">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalcatholic.com/SaintRoch.htm |title=Cultural Catholic - Saint Roch (Saint Rocco) |author=Webmaster (webmaster@culturalcatholic.com)|publisher=culturalcatholic.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>

[[Saint Guinefort]] was the name given to a dog who received local veneration as a [[saint]] at a French shrine from the 13th to the 20th centuries.<ref>Stephen de Bourbon (died 1262): ''De Supersticione''</ref>

A black and white dog is sometimes used as an informal symbol of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] order of [[friar]]s, religious sisters and [[nuns]]. This stems from a Latin pun: though the order's name is actually the Friars Preachers (''Ordus Praedicatorum'' - order of preachers), it is generally called the Dominicans (after St. Dominic, their founder): ''Domini canes'' in Latin means ""the dogs/hounds of the Lord.""

=== Ancient Egyptian religion ===
The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians are often more associated with cats in the form of [[Bastet]], yet here too, dogs are found to have a sacred role and figure as an important symbol in religious iconography.<ref name=""google"">{{cite book|title=Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation|author=Frankfort, H.|date=2011|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486411385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYhfazYeAnUC|page=9|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>

Dogs were associated with [[Anubis]], the jackal headed god of the underworld. At times throughout its period of being in use the Anubieion catacombs at [[Saqqara]] saw the burial of dogs.<ref name=""google2"">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt|author=Bard, K.A.|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780203982839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>

=== Greek mythology ===

Dogs were closely associated with [[Hecate]] in the Classical world. Dogs were sacred to [[Artemis]] and [[Ares]]. [[Cerberus]] was the three-faced guard dog of the Underworld.

=== Hinduism ===
[[File:Bhairav.JPG|thumb|150px|right|[[Bhairava]] with his dog.]]
{{see|Category:Dogs in Hinduism}}
The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival that falls roughly in November every year. 
The dog (''[[Shvan]]'') is also the [[vahana]] or mount of the Hindu god [[Bhairava]]. [[Yudhishthira]] had approached heaven with his dog,<ref>Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism, p. 53, by Wendy Doniger, publisher = Manchester University Press</ref> therefore among many Hindus, the common belief exists that caring for or adopting dogs can also pave way to heaven.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islam and dogs}}

The majority of both Sunni and Shi'a Muslim jurists consider dogs to be [[Ritual purification|ritually unclean]].<ref name=""Fadl"">[http://www.scholarofthehouse.org/dinistrandna.html ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature''], s.v.

There are a number of traditions concerning [[Muhammad]]'s attitude towards dogs. He said that the company of dogs, except as helpers in hunting, herding, and home protection, voided a portion of a Muslim's good deeds.<ref>[[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Muwatta Imam Malik|al-Muwatta]] (Egypt: al-Babi al-Halabi, n.d.), 2:969. Reported in El Fadl</ref>  On the other hand, he advocated kindness to dogs and other animals.  <ref>Abu Huraira Volume 3, Book 40, Number 551.</ref><ref name=""usc.edu"">http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/040.sbt.html Compendium of Muslim Texts - Abu Huraira, Volume 3, Book 40, Number 551</ref> [[Abu Huraira]] narrated that the prophet said:
<blockquote>""While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, 'This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.' So, he (went down the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him.'' The people asked ``O Allah's Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?'' He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).''<ref name=""usc.edu""/></blockquote>

=== Judaism ===

In [[Judaism]], [[Jewish law]] does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets.<ref name=""jewishvirtuallibrary.org"">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/animals.html|title=Judaism & The Treatment of Animals |work=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref> Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves, and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.<ref name=""jewishvirtuallibrary.org""/> The Book of Exodus (22:31) includes the exhortation ""And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs"" which implies that dogs have an accepted role in Hebrew society, and that God does not expect them to observe the dietary restrictions imposed on their human masters. The name of the Biblical character [[Caleb]] is written the same way as ''keleb'' ({{lang-he|כָּ֫לֶב}}), meaning ""dog"" - written Hebrew having no [[vowel]]s. The Bible was written down centuries before [[Hebrew diacritics]] were introduced, and there is thus no certain knowledge of how the name was pronounced during the man's own lifetime - leaving open the possibility that at that time it was no dishonor for a major tribal leader to be named ""Dog"".

=== Mesopotamia ===
There is a temple in Isin, Mesopotamia, named é-ur-gi7-ra which translates as “dog house”<ref>Livingstone, A (1988). ""The Isin “Dog House” Revisited"", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, '''40''' (1), p54</ref> Enlilbani, a king from the Old Babylonian First Dynasty of Isin, commemorated the temple to the goddess Ninisina.<ref>Shaffer, Aaron (1974). ""Enlilbaniand the ‘DogHouse’ in Isin"", Journal of Cuneiform Studies, 26(4) p. 251-252)</ref> Although there is a small amount of detail known about it, there is enough information to confirm that a dog cult did exist in this area.<ref>Livingstone ibid, 1988, p. 58</ref> Usually, dogs were only associated with the Gula cult, but there is some information, like Enlilbani’s commemoration, to suggest that dogs were also important to the cult of Ninisina, as Gula was another goddess who was closely associated to Ninisina.<ref>Shaffer, Aaron (1974) Ibid, p. 253</ref> More than 30 dog burials, numerous dog sculptures, and dog drawings were discovered when the area around this Ninisina temple was excavated. In the Gula cult, the dog was used in oaths and was sometimes referred to as a divinity.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Philistines ===

At archaeological diggings at the [[Philistines| Philistine]] city of [[Ashkelon]], [[Ashkelon dog cemetery|a very large dog cemetery]] was discovered in the layer dating from when the city was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire| Persian Empire]]. It is believed the dogs may have had a sacred role - however, evidence for this is not conclusive.

=== Zoroastrianism ===
In [[Zoroastrianism]], the dog is regarded as an especially beneficent, clean and righteous creature, which must be fed and taken care of.<ref name=boyce>Boyce, Mary 1989. A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period. P.303</ref> The dog is praised for the useful work it performs in the household,<ref name=""avesta"">{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd13sbe.htm |title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 13. |<!--########## Vendidad 13:39-40 #########--> |author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref> but it is also seen as having special spiritual virtues. A dog's gaze is considered to be purifying and to drive off [[daeva]]s (demons). It is also believed to have a special connection with the [[afterlife]]: the [[Chinvat Bridge|Chinwad Bridge]] to Heaven is said to be guarded by dogs in Zoroastrian scripture,<ref name=""avesta""/> and dogs are traditionally fed in commemoration of the dead.<ref name=iranica/> ''Ihtiram-i sag'', ""respect for the dog"", is a common injunction among Iranian Zoroastrian villagers.<ref name=boyce/>

Detailed prescriptions for the appropriate treatment of dogs are found in the [[Vendidad]] (a subdivision of the Zoroastrian holy scripture [[Avesta]]), especially in chapters 13, 14 and 15, where harsh punishments are imposed for harm inflicted upon a dog and the faithful are required to assist dogs, both domestic and stray, in various ways; often, help or harm to a dog is equated with help and harm to a human.<ref name=""avesta2"">{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd_tc.htm |title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD: Table of Contents |<!--########## Vendidad 13,14,15 #########--> |author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref> The killing of a dog (""a shepherd's dog, or a house-dog, or a Vohunazga [i.e. stray] dog, or a trained dog"") is considered to lead to damnation in the afterlife.<ref name=""avesta2""/> A homeowner is required to take care of a pregnant dog that lies near his home at least until the puppies are born (and in some cases until the puppies are old enough to take care of themselves, namely six months). If the homeowner does not help the dog and the puppies come to harm as a result, ""he shall pay for it the penalty for wilful murder"", because ""[[Atar]] (Fire), the son of [[Ahura Mazda]], watches as well (over a pregnant dog) as he does over a woman"".<ref>[http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 15], passim, e.g. 21.</ref> It is also a major sin if a man harms a dog by giving it bones that are too hard and become stuck in its throat, or food that is too hot, so that it burns its throat.<ref>[http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 15], 2-4.</ref> Giving bad food to a dog is as bad as serving bad food to a human.<ref>http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd15sbe.htm Vendidad, Fargard 13, 20-28</ref> The believers are required to take care of a dog with a damaged sense of smell, to try to heal it ""in the same manner as they would do for one of the faithful"" and, if they fail, to tie it lest it should fall into a hole or a body of water and be harmed.<ref name=""avesta""/>

Both according to the Vendidad and in traditional Zoroastrian practice, dogs are allotted some funerary ceremonies analogous to those of humans.<ref name=iranica>Encyclopaedia Iranica:Dog. In Zoroastrianism. By Mary Boyce.</ref> In the Vendidad, it is stated that the spirits of a thousand deceased dogs are reincarnated in a single [[otter]] (""water dog""), hence the killing of an otter is a terrible crime that brings drought and famine upon the land and must be atoned either by the death of the killer<ref name=""avesta""/> or by the killer performing a very long list of deeds considered pious, including the healing of dogs, raising of puppies, paying of fines to priests, as well as killing of animals considered noxious and unholy (cats, rats, mice and various species of reptiles, amphibians, and insects).<ref name=""avesta3"">{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd14sbe.htm|title=AVESTA: VENDIDAD (English): Fargard 14.|author=Joseph H. Peterson|publisher=avesta.org|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>

''[[Sagdid]]'' is a funeral [[ceremony]] in which a dog is brought into the room where the body is lying so that it can look on it. “Sagdid” means “dog sight” in the [[Middle Persian|Middle Persian language]] of Zoroastrian theological works. There are various spiritual benefits thought to be obtained by the ceremony. It is believed that the original purpose was to make certain that the person was really dead, since the dog’s more acute senses would be able to detect signs of life that a human might miss. A “four-eyed” dog, that is one with two spots on its forehead, is preferred for sagdid.<ref>Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, 1928, [http://www.avesta.org/ritual/funeral.htm The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees], Anthropological Society of Bombay</ref><ref>The Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research, by Solomon Alexander Nigosian, Published by McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7735-1144-X}}, 9780773511446 page 102 (page can be viewed via Google books)</ref>

The traditional rites involving dogs have been under attack by reformist Zoroastrians since the mid-19th century, and they had abandoned them completely by the late 20th century. Even traditionalist Zoroastrians tend to restrict such rites to a significant extent nowadays (late 20th - early 21st century).<ref name=iranica/>

==Criticism of religion==
The Ancient Greek philosopher and critic of social mores [[Diogenes of Sinope#Diogenes the dog|Diogenes of Sinope]] was recorded as living with many dogs, seeing their freedom from self-consciousness and sincere enjoyment of simple physical pleasure to be admirable role models.

In an article in the ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' [[atheist]] [[Natalie Angier]] quoted [[Frans de Waal]], a [[Primatology|primatologist]] at [[Emory University]]:
:""I've argued that many of what philosophers call moral sentiments can be seen in other species. In [[chimpanzee]]s and other animals, you see examples of sympathy, empathy, reciprocity, a willingness to follow social rules. Dogs are a good example of a species that have and obey social rules; that's why we like them so much, even though they're large [[carnivores]].""<ref name=""nytimes"">{{cite web|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20010114mag-atheism.html |title=Confessions of a Lonely Atheist |<!--########## ""Confessions of a Lonely Atheist"" #########--> |publisher=partners.nytimes.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>
[[File:Landseer Saved.jpg|thumb|A [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], the breed Byron eulogized, painted by [[Edwin Henry Landseer]], 1802–1873]]
In 1808 the English poet [[Lord Byron]] expressed similar thoughts in his famous poem ''[[Epitaph to a Dog]]'':
:But the poor dog, in life the firmest friend,
:The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
:Whose honest heart is still his master's own,
:Who labors, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
:Unhonored falls, unnoticed all his worth,
:Denied in heaven the soul he held on earth –
:While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
:And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.<ref name=""poetryloverspage"">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/byron/byron_ind.html |title=Poetry Lovers' Page: George Gordon Byron |<!--########## Epitaph To a Dog #########--> |publisher=poetryloverspage.com|accessdate=2015-05-12}}</ref>

'''Roan''' is a coat color found in many animals, including [[horse]]s, [[cattle]] and [[dog]]s.  It is defined generally as an even mixture of white and pigmented hairs that do not [[Gray (horse)|""gray out""]] or fade as the animal ages.<ref name=OEDroan>""''roan'', ''a''. and ''n.1''"" [[Oxford English Dictionary]]. 2nd edition 1989. OED Online. [[Oxford University Press]]. 3 June 2008. <http://0-dictionary.oed.com.helin.uri.edu/cgi/entry/50207603>.</ref> There are a variety of genetic conditions which produce the colors described as ""roan"" in various species.

Identifiable types of roans include true or classic [[roan (horse)|roan]], [[varnish roan]], and [[rabicano]], though other currently unknown factors may be responsible for ambiguous ""roaning.""<ref name=ucdroanzyg>{{cite web |url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/Roan.php |title=Roan Zygosity Test Information |work=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory Services |publisher=UC Davis |accessdate=2009-10-01}}</ref> [[Gray (horse)|Gray]] horses, which become lighter as they age until their hair coat is nearly completely white, may be confused with roans when they are young.<ref name=UCDint/> [[dun gene|Duns]], which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun [[dilution gene|dilution factor]] on their bodies but with darker points, are also sometimes confused with roans, but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan.

Horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body. Except for [[Horse markings|white markings]] under the control of other genes, the head, mane, tail, and lower legs are dark.<ref name=UCDint/> Roan is a simple [[Dominance relationship|dominant]] trait symbolized by the ''Rn'' [[allele]].<ref name=ucdroanzyg /> The [[University of California, Davis]] [[University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine|School of Veterinary Medicine]]'s genetics services have developed a [[DNA test]] that uses [[genetic marker]]s to indirectly determine the number of ''Rn'' or ''rn'' alleles a horse has.<ref name=ucdroanzyg /> The [[mutation]] responsible for true roan has not yet been identified exactly, but been assigned to equine [[chromosome]] 21 (ECA21) in the KIT sequence.<ref name=marklund>{{cite journal | last =Marklund | first =S |author2=M Moller |author3=K Sandberg |author4=L Andersson  | year =1999 | title =Close association between sequence polymorphism in the KIT gene and the roan coat color in horses | journal =Mammalian Genome | volume =10 | pages =283–288 | doi =10.1007/s003359900987 | pmid =10051325 | issue =3 }}</ref> The overall effect is that of a silver or lightened appearance to the affected part of the coat.
[[File:BayRoan.jpg|thumb|Bay Roan with corn marks]]
Descriptions of roan [[Equine coat color|coat colors]] are as follows:
* '''Red Roan''' or strawberry roan describes true or classic roan on a [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] base coat. The mane and tail remain red or have only a few white hairs, while the body ranges from nearly chestnut to pinkish. Geneticists prefer the term ""chestnut roan,"" but this term is not in common use.
* '''Bay Roan''' is true roan on a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] coat. The particular shade depends on the underlying shade of bay; but the mane, tail, and lower legs are black, and the reddish body is intermingled with white hairs. The head is usually red. Formerly, bay roans were lumped together with chestnut roans and both called ""red roans.""
* '''Blue Roan''' is true roan on a [[Black (horse)|black]] coat. The mane, tail, head, and legs remain black, while the body takes on a grayish or bluish appearance. Blue roans are sometimes mistaken for [[Gray (horse)|grays]] or [[grullo]]s. However, Grays fade with age, while roans do not; and grullos are blue [[dun gene|duns]] and possess dun markings but not intermingled white hairs.

Any other coat color may also be affected by roaning. Few combinations have the same unique terminology applied to the common roan colors, although palomino roans are sometimes called ''honey roans''.
[[Image:VarnishRoan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A varnish roan [[Appaloosa]], showing white sclera, mottled skin, and darker bony regions such as the cheekbones.]]

===Roan mimics===
A [[varnish roan]] is not a true roan; it is actually one of the [[leopard complex]] coat patterns associated with [[Appaloosa]], [[Knabstrupper]], [[Noriker horse]] and related breeds. [[Rabicano]] is a white pattern that falls into the category of ''roaning'' or scattered white hairs, the genetics of which are not yet fully understood.<ref name=UCDint/> Sometimes called ''ticking'', rabicano is common even in breeds that do not have true or classic roan, including [[Arabian (horse)|Arabians]] and [[Thoroughbred]]s. This pattern usually takes the form of scattered white hairs around the junction of the stifle and flank, and peculiar rings of white hairs near the base of the tail. This trait is called a ''coon tail'' or ''skunk tail''.<ref name=overton>{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Overton |title=In The Genes |url=http://www.hancockhorses.com/article-roanQHNews.pdf |format=PDF |work=Quarter Horse News |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |pages=24–6 |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2008-06-04 }}</ref>  Some forms of [[sabino horse|sabino]], which is a [[pinto horse|pinto]] pattern, have roaning along the edges of other white spots or [[horse markings|markings]]  A roan horse may not fit into any of the traditional categories as there is much still to be learned about the genetics of roan.  The existence of other types of roaning conditions not covered by those mentioned here is possible and likely.<ref name=""UCDint""/>

The roan or ticked color is described in many breeds of [[gundog]]s such as [[English Cocker Spaniel]]s, [[American Cocker Spaniel]]s, [[English Springer Spaniel]]s, [[Field Spaniel]]s and [[Brittany (dog)|Brittanys]], [[German Longhaired Pointer]]s, [[German Shorthaired Pointer]]s, [[Spinone Italiano|Spinoni Italiani]], [[Lagotto Romagnolo]]s and [[English Setter]]s, as well as [[Border Collie]]s and many other breeds.

In dogs, roan manifests itself only in unpigmented areas, the presence and shape of which are determined by other genes.<ref name=schmutzdog>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.usask.ca/~schmutz/dogspots.html |title=Spotted Patterns |accessdate=2008-06-04 |last=Schmutz |first=Sheila |date=2007-11-12 |work=Dog Coat Color Genetics }}</ref> This is in stark contrast to true roan horses and roan cattle, which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings.

Breeds of [[cattle]] known for roans are the [[Belgian Blue]] and [[Shorthorn]].

==Roan guinea pigs==
The [[Domestic varieties of guinea pigs|roan coloration]] of [[guinea pig]]s is linked to [[microphthalmia]]. The allele that controls roaning in guinea pigs is incompletely dominant: an animal with one copy of the allele will have varying amounts of white hair scattered through its coat, particularly on the back and sides. This is not to be confused with the 'Magpie' variety, which is a brindled guinea pig lacking red pigment due to the ""chinchilla"" allele also responsible for self white and silver agouti coloration.

About 25% of guinea pigs born to a mating of two roans are completely white, with a constellation of deformities called lethal white syndrome, although it has no relation to overo lethal white syndrome in horses or double merle syndrome in dogs. These symptoms include:
* Partial or complete [[blindness]]
* Partial or complete [[deafness]]
* [[Microphthalmia]] or [[anophthalmia]]
* [[Pigmentation|Unpigmented]] eyes
* Missing or deformed [[incisor]]s
* Deformed [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]
* Elongated [[tooth]] roots
* Malabsorption in the small intestine, due in some cases to lack of [[intestinal villi]]
* Increased susceptibility to [[illness]]

It is worth noting that, unlike [[anophthalmia|anophthalmic]] hamsters, lethal white guinea pigs are not sterile. Females may be unable to deliver live young.

Lethal white guinea pigs have a decreased lifespan in general, although individuals have reportedly lived to 6 or 7 years. Many die shortly after birth or at weaning age. With hand-feeding and regular dental care, lethals can live 2–3 years.
<!--A separate section on roan mice may be warranted, but the original intent of that section was to clarify that some ""roaning"" in horses is presently unexplained.-->

__NOGALLERY__"
36477294,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhu,"'''Panhu''' (盤瓠 /{{IPA|pǎn hǔ}}/) is an important figure in [[Chinese mythology]]. ""Chinese mythology"" refers to those myths found in the historical geographic area of [[China]], the geographic area of ""China"" being a concept which has evolved historically. The Panhu mythological complex includes myths in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and also other languages. This myth has a long history of being transmitted by [[Han Chinese]] and several of the other ethnic groups of the fifty-six officially recognized by the current administration of China, both orally and in literature.<ref>[http://202.40.204.216/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0304.pdf 盤瓠與民族原推圖騰神話]</ref><ref>[http://202.40.204.216/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0302.pdf 盤瓠 ― 民族推源圖騰]</ref> (Yang 2005:4) The Panhu myth is an important origin myth for various ethnic groups.

==Basic myth==
The basic Panhu myth is about a dragon-dog who transforms into a man and married a princess. The emperor of China in the course of losing a war which he was waging with a neighbor to the west, offered to marry his daughter to anybody that would present him with the head of his enemy. This was accomplished by the dragon-dog. Accounts vary, but eventually the dog and princess procreated copiously.

==Variants==
There are also various variant versions.<ref>[http://iel.cass.cn/news_show.asp?newsid=2045 盘瓠神话：楚与卢戎的一场战争·中国民族文学网]</ref><ref>[http://www.hmongbq.com/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=230 苗族民间祭祀制度 吴正彪]</ref><ref>[http://www.library.ln.edu.hk/etext/chi/chi305/2002_3/pdf/chi305_0304.pdf 葉曉文 盤瓠與民族原推圖騰神話]</ref><ref>[http://commons.ln.edu.hk/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=chin_proj_1 盤瓠神話]</ref> In some the dog became transformed into a human, except for his head. (Christie 1968: 121-122)

==Myth versus history==
In the study of historical Chinese culture, many of the stories that have been told regarding characters and events which have been written or told of the distant past have a double tradition: one which tradition which presents a more historicized and one which presents a more mythological version. (Yang 2005:12-13) This is also true in many of the accounts related to the Panhu.

==Religion==
Many of the myths regarding agriculture in China are related to popular religion and ritual. In modern times, Panhu has been worshipped by the [[Yao people]] and [[She people]] as ""King Pan"". (Yang 2005: 52-53).

[[Sei Shōnagon]]'s observations of the [[Heian period|Heian]] court at the end of the tenth-century in {{nihongo|''[[The Pillow Book]]''|枕草子|''Makura no sōshi''}} include passages that resemble a [[poetic diary]], others in an [[Zuihitsu|essay-like style]], as well as a number of poetic catalogues or {{nihongo|'detailing of things'|ものはつくし}}.<ref name=""Inu""/><ref>{{cite journal |title=Sei Shōnagon's Poetic Catalogues |author=Morris, Mark |journal=[[Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies]] |publisher=[[Harvard–Yenching Institute]] |year=1980 |volume=40 | issue = 1 |pages=5–54 |doi=10.2307/2718916}}</ref> For instance, under the heading Elegant Things: 'a white coat worn over a violet [[Japanese clothing|waistcoat]], duck eggs, shaved ice mixed with [[liana]] syrup placed in a new silver bowl, rock-crystal [[Buddhist prayer beads|prayer beads]], [[wisteria]] blossoms, [[Prunus mume|plum blossoms]] covered with snow, a beautiful child eating strawberries'.<ref name=""Shirane"">{{cite book |title=Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology (1600-1900) |author=Shirane, Haruo |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2002 |ISBN=0-231-10991-1 |pages=21–4}}</ref>

''Inu makura'' similarly comprises a number of such listings under a series of headings, although without the [[narrative]] accompaniment.

In 2007, Queen Elizabeth II had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly. During the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 Olympic opening ceremony]], Monty, Willow and Holly made an appearance when [[James Bond]] (portrayed by [[Daniel Craig]]) arrived at [[Buckingham Palace]] to escort the Queen to the event. Monty had previously belonged to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], and died soon after in September 2012.

==History==
The royal corgis are known all across the world and have been portrayed in many ways such as statues and works of art.  For example, the [[crown coin]] which commemorated [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|the Queen's Golden Jubilee]] shows her with a corgi.

[[Elizabeth II]]'s mother, at that time [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], introduced a disciplined regimen for the dogs; each was to have its own [[wicker]] basket, raised above the floor to avoid drafts. Meals were served for each dog in its own dish, the diet approved by [[veterinary physician|veterinary expert]]s with no tidbits from the royal table. A proprietary brand of meat dog biscuits was served in the morning, while the late afternoon meal consisted of dog meal with gravy.

'''''Dog World''''' is a weekly [[newspaper]] published in the United Kingdom. It is one of two specialist publications - the other being [[Our Dogs (newspaper)|Our Dogs]] - catering mainly for the serious enthusiast of the [[purebred dog|pedigree dog]] but with content aimed at all who are interested in dogs. It should not be confused with the [[Dog World]] magazine published in the USA.

==Profile==
NOW CEASED TRADING
Each week Dog World contains news concerning all aspects of the [[dog|canine]] world, in particular details of current events affecting dog owners, breeders, exhibitors and those who compete with their dogs in activities such as [[dog obedience|obedience]], [[dog agility|agility]], [[field trial|gundog work]] and [[heelwork to music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dog activities and competitive events|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/|publisher=[[The Kennel Club]]|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> Extensive coverage is given to political issues which may affect all dog owners.
Regular feature articles include informed comment on the [[conformation show|show scene]] and other competitive activities, living with dogs, veterinary topics, the dog in art, travelling with dogs, and young people and their dogs. Since 1993, the regular weekly column 'A Vet's View' has been written by Professor Steve Dean, a KC Charitable Trust trustee<ref>{{cite web|title=KC Charitable Trust appoints an additional trustee|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=3033|publisher=[[The Kennel Club]]|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> who became Chairman of the Kennel Club in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=KC Senior executive staff|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/2067|publisher=[[The Kennel Club]]|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Dean is new chairman of the KC|url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/55133/News/22-Breaking-news2|publisher=Dog World|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref>
All the major [[conformation show|dog shows]] in Britain are reported on, with the principal results and photographs of the main winners, and there is comprehensive news from events overseas.

The breeds recognised by [[The Kennel Club]] each have a regular column written by an experienced enthusiast, and a major part of the paper consists of judges' reports from the shows. The listings section includes details of forthcoming canine events.
In association with companies well known in the world of dogs, Dog World runs annual points competitions to find the leading show dog, stud dog and brood bitch in each breed, sponsored by Arden Grange, [[Royal Canin]] and Lintbells respectively, as well as the Pup of the Year contest, sponsored by [[Nestle Purina]],  in which the cream of the young animals can compete.

The [[Audit_Bureau_of_Circulations_(UK)|Audit Bureau]] records a 98.8 per cent purchased average circulation figure of 11,700 print copies each week throughout 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cross platform circulation certificate|url=http://www.abc.org.uk/Certificates/18253366.pdf|publisher=Audit Bureau of Circulation|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref>

==Dog politics==
Dog World has traditionally published a wide cross section of opinion and has often taken issue with the Kennel Club (KC). Issues have included how the KC deals with complaints about judges' critiques.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judge critiques|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=845|publisher=[[The Kennel Club]]|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> Columnists such as Steven Seymour have often been very critical of the lack of democracy in the KC. In 2010 the ""Clarges Street Clarion"" column written by a Kennel Club insider under the pseudonym ""Trumpeter"" was withdrawn due to the writer's disagreements with editorial policy. 

In 2008 the British dog world was shaken by the television programme [[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]. Dog World was widely regarded as taking a softer line towards the programme and reforms that followed it than its rival Our Dogs. Most Dog World columnists took the view that PDE, although sensationalist and damaging, had made some valid points. One columnist, Kevin Colwill, was and remains largely supportive of the programme and the subsequent reforms in the pedigree word.   

Dog World's website often has a majority of posters hostile to the KC and supportive of the health reform agenda although this may not be a true reflection of the feelings of the paper's readership.

==Associated publications==
At intervals throughout the year, free supplements are issued with the weekly newspaper, dealing with individual breeds, groups of breeds or special topics. These include a guide to  the world's best known and largest dog show, [[Crufts]], which takes place in Birmingham each March, and another supplement featuring exclusively the leading show dogs of the previous year.
Since the 1920s the company has also produced each December the glossy Dog World Annual which includes feature articles connected with the show scene, reports from around the world and advertisements from leading breeders and exhibitors.

==History==
What is now Dog World first appeared on 21 February 1902, under the title of '''Illustrated Kennel News'''.<ref name=""Bengtson536"">[[#Bengtson2008|Bengtson (2008)]]: p. 536</ref> It was edited by George Krehl, breeder and importer of a number of breeds and former editor of the dog section of The Stockkeeper. Proprietors included a number of the most eminent personalities of the dog scene of the time.
In April 1918 the paper was renamed '''Country World and Illustrated Kennel News''', this title lasting just under a year as the name Dog World was adopted on 4 April 1919.
Of its editors, the longest serving in subsequent years were Phyllis Robson in the 1930s and '40s. Robson bred [[Bulldog]]s but was better known for her successful [[Afghan Hound]] [[Champion (dog)|Ch.]] Asri-Havid of Ghazni. She often travelled to America and was described by Bengtson as ""one of the emerging dog world's first international celebrities."" On becoming editor, she retired from judging.<ref name=""Bengtson536"">[[#Bengtson2008|Bengtson (2008)]]: p. 536</ref>

Editor in the 1950s and early '60s was the famous all-breed judge Leo Wilson. He had a successful kennel of [[Fox Terrier (Smooth)|Smooth Fox Terriers]].<ref name=""Bengtson536"">[[#Bengtson2008|Bengtson (2008)]]: p. 536</ref>

Ferelith Hamilton, later Somerfield, one of Britain's best known dog judges, edited the paper from 1967 to 1986. She was followed by Simon Parsons, noted Corgi breeder and judge, to 2003. 

The next editor, Stuart Baillie, was a departure in that he was not a ""dog person"" but a professional journalist. Baillie forged a partnership with Kerry Williamson, the company's Managing Director,<ref name=""parsons1"">{{cite web|last=Parsons|first=Simon|title=Kerry Williamson|url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/53213/News/06-kerry-(1)|publisher=Dog World|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> that modernized and developed the paper. Baillie undertook a buy out of the paper in November 2007 and become joint-owner with Williamson.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dog eat dog world of publishing|url=http://www.bexhillobserver.net/news/business-news/dog-eat-dog-world-of-publishing-1-1447339|publisher=Bexhill Observer|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>
After Williamson's death<ref name=""parsons1""/><ref>{{cite web|last=Moores|first=Bill|title=Kerry Williamson|url=http://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2010/Feb2010/News120210/kerry.htm|publisher=Our Dogs|accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref> Baillie became the sole owner of the company. He took over the role of managing director and, after a period operating under interim editors, the editorship passed to Damian Duro. 
Under Baillie's direction the company has moved into video production with dog world.tv. and it directs/produces the [[Horse and Country TV]] programme 'Around The Dog World'. The programme first launched in 2011 and includes footage and interviews filmed at a variety of championship [[Conformation_show|dog shows]] throughout the UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=Around the Dog World|url=http://www.horseandcountry.tv/tv/programmes/around-the-dog-world|publisher=Horse & Country TV|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> On 8 June 2017 the company went into administration (formally announced on 13 June in ''[[The London Gazette]]''); trading ceased on 23 June.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.creditman.co.uk/news/appointment-of-administrators-notices-13-june-2017/|title=Appointment of Administrators Notices – 13 June 2017|website=Credit Man|language=en|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Dog World Limited|publisher=Our Dogs|date=30 June 2017|p=3}}</ref>

[[File:Canis lupus howling on glacial erratic.jpg|thumb|400px|The dog diverged from a now-extinct population of wolves immediately before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], when much of Eurasia was a cold, dry [[mammoth steppe]] [[biome]].]]
The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. The [[domestic dog]] is a member of genus ''[[Canis]]'' (canines) that forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]], and is the most widely abundant [[carnivore]].<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1999/> The closest living relative of the dog is the [[gray wolf]] and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vonholdt2010/><ref name=vila1997/> The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister [[clades]],<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,<ref name=giemsch2015/> with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.<ref name=germonpre2009/>  These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human [[hunter-gatherers]] and not [[agriculturists]].<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/> The dog was the first domesticated species.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=larson2012/><ref name=britannica/><ref name=perri2016/>

Where the [[genetic divergence]] of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=machugh2016/> Central Asia,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=shannon2015/> and East Asia.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=wang2015/> This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian groups; these, before going extinct, were domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations between 14,000–6,400 years ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=grimm2016/>

==Canid and human evolution==
Six million years ago at the close of the [[Miocene]] era, the earth's climate was gradually cooling and this would lead to the glaciations of the [[Pliocene]] and the [[Pleistocene]] (the Ice Age). In many areas the forests and savannahs were being replaced with steppe or grasslands and only those creatures that could adapt would survive. On opposite sides of the planet, two very different lineages would adapt to these changes and their evolution would produce two species that would become the most widely distributed of mammals. In southern North America, small woodland foxes were growing bigger and becoming more adapted to running, and by the late Miocene the first of the genus ''Canis'' had arisen, the ancestors of coyotes, wolves and the domestic dog. In eastern Africa, a split was occurring among the large primates. Some would remain in the trees, while others would move out of the trees, learn to walk upright, develop enlarged brains, and learn to avoid predators while becoming a predator themselves in the more open country.<ref name=nowak2003/> The two lineages would ultimately meet on the Eurasian continent. ""They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined.""<ref name=derr2011/>

==Dog evolution==
Dog evolution (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|evolutio}}'': ""unrolling"")<ref name=oxford2014a/> is the biological descent with modification<ref name=darwin1859/> that led to the domestic dog. This process encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).<ref name=berkeley2015/>

The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large [[carnivore]].<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1999/> When and where dogs were first domesticated has vexed geneticists for the past 20 years and archaeologists for many decades longer.<ref name=larson2014/> Identifying the earliest dogs is difficult because the key [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters that are used by zooarchaeologists to differentiate domestic dogs from their wild wolf ancestors (size and position of teeth, dental pathologies, and size and proportion of cranial and [[postcranial]] elements) were not yet fixed during the initial phases of the domestication process. The range of natural variation among these characters that may have existed in ancient wolf populations, and the time it took for these traits to appear in dogs, are unknown.<ref name=larson2012/>

However, recent studies based on [[genetics]] propose four generalizations about dogs.<ref name=freedman2016b/>

*Over the past million years, numerous wolf-like forms existed but their turnover has been high, and modern wolves are not the lineal ancestors of dogs.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=leonard2004/> Although research had suggested that dogs and wolves were genetically very close relatives,<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=wayne1999/><ref name=wayne1993/> later [[phylogenetic analysis]] strongly supported the hypothesis that the dog forms a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] that is sister to Eurasian wolves, and these together form a sister clade to North American wolves.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=freedman2016b/> This indicates that an extant wolf population ancestral to dogs has not been found, and is presumed that the wolves immediately ancestral to dogs are extinct.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> The dog is not a separate species to the wolf.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=freedman2016b/>
*The dog was the first domesticated species<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=larson2012/><ref name=britannica/><ref name=perri2016/> and appeared more than 15,000 [[years before present]] (YBP), with recent studies proposing a divergence time closer to 27,000 YBP.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=skoglund2015/> The dog was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and the domestication of other animals around 10,000 YBP,<ref name=larson2012/> indicating that dogs were domesticated by [[hunter-gatherers]] and not early [[agriculturalists]].<ref name=schleidt1998/> Studies support two [[population bottlenecks]] had occurred to the dog lineage, one due to the initial domestication and one due to the formation of [[dog breeds]].<ref name=freedman2016b/>
*Dogs show both ancient and modern lineages. The ancient lineages appear most in Asia but least in Europe because the [[Victorian era]] development of modern dog breeds used little of the ancient lineages.<ref name=vonholdt2010/><ref name=shannon2015/><ref name=frantz2016/> All dog populations (breed, village, and feral) show some evidence of [[genetic admixture]] between modern and ancient dogs. Some ancient dog populations that once occupied Europe and the New World no longer exist.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=leonard2002/> This implies that some ancient dog populations were entirely replaced and others admixed over a long period of time.<ref name=freedman2016b/>
*There was admixture between dog and regional wolf populations except on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and in the New World wolves.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=freedman2014/> This admixture has occurred throughout history and as dogs expanded across the landscape. There are some dog populations that show recent admixture with wolves.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=freedman2016b/>

The extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs, and the sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations over at least the last 10,000 years, has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=larson2012/> An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene, all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined with humans.<ref name=morey2016/><ref name=morey2015/>

===Time of divergence===
====Paleoecology====
[[File:Dwelling made with mammoth bones.jpg|thumb|Mammoth bone dwelling, Mezhirich site, Ukraine]]

During the last [[Quaternary glaciation|Ice Age]], the most recent peak is known as the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] when a vast [[mammoth steppe]] stretched from [[Spain]] eastwards across [[Eurasia]] and over the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] into [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]]. The continent of Europe was much colder and drier than it is today, with polar desert in the north and the remainder [[steppe]] or [[tundra]]. Forest and woodland were almost non-existent except for isolated pockets in the mountain ranges of southern Europe.<ref name=adams/> The [[Late Pleistocene]] was characterized by a series of severe and rapid climate oscillations with regional temperature changes of up to 16&nbsp;°C, which has been correlated with [[Pleistocene megafauna]]l [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction]]s. There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], indicating that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors. Multiple events appear to have caused the rapid replacement of one species by another one within the same [[genus]], or one population by another within the same species, across a broad area. As some species became extinct, so too did the predators that depended on them.<ref name=cooper2015/> The ancestors of modern humans first reached Europe, with their remains dated 43,000-45,000 years BP in [[Italy]]<ref name=benazzi2011/> and in [[Great Britain|Britain]].<ref name=higham2011/>

:''See further: [[Megafaunal wolf#Paleoecology|Paleoecology at this time]]''

====Probable ancestor====
During the Last Glacial Maximum there were two types of wolf. The cold north of the [[Holarctic]] was spanned by a large, robust, wolf [[ecomorph]] that specialised in preying on megafauna. Another more slender form lived in the warmer south in refuges from the glaciation. When the planet warmed and the Late Glacial Maximum came to a close, whole species of megafauna became extinct along with their predators, leaving the more gracile wolf to dominate the Holarctic. The more gracile wolf was the ancestor of the modern gray wolf, which is the dog's sister but not its ancestor as the dog shows a closer genetic relationship to the now-extinct [[megafaunal wolf]].''

:''See further: [[Evolution of the wolf#Two wolf haplogroups|Two wolf haplogroups]]''

====Evolutionary divergence====
[[File:Gray_wolf_(Canis_Lupis).jpg|thumb|DNA evidence indicates that the dog, the modern gray wolf (above) and the now-extinct Taimyr wolf diverged from a now extinct wolf that once lived in Europe.]]

The date estimated for the evolutionary divergence of a domestic lineage from a wild one does not necessarily indicate the start of the domestication process but it does provide an upper boundary. The divergence of the domestic horse from the lineage that led to the modern [[Przewalski’s horse]] is estimated at 45,000 YBP but the archaeological record indicates 5,500 YBP. The variance could be due to the modern wild population not being the direct ancestor of the domestic one, or the impact of a split due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. The divergence time does not imply domestication during this specific period.<ref name=machugh2016/> Earlier researchers had proposed that the ""dog was the dog before it was domesticated"",<ref name=fox1978/> and that the ancestor of ''Canis familiaris'' was a wild ''Canis familiaris''.<ref name=manwell1983/>

Early [[mitochondrial DNA]] analysis indicated that if the dog had descended from the modern gray wolf then the divergence would have occurred 135,000 YBP.<ref name=vila1997/> Two later studies using [[whole genome sequencing]] indicated divergence times of 32,000 YBP<ref name=wang2013/> or 11,000-16,000 YBP,<ref name=freedman2014/> with the assumed [[mutation rate]] ""the dominant source of uncertainty in dating the origin of dogs.""<ref name=freedman2014/>

:''See further: [[Evolution of the wolf#Timing issue|Mutation rate timing issue]]''

In 2015, a study was conducted on a partial rib-bone (designated as Taimyr-1) found near the Bolshaya Balakhnaya River in the [[Taymyr Peninsula]], Arctic [[North Asia]], that was [[Accelerator mass spectrometry#Applications|AMS]] [[radiocarbon dated]] to 34,900 YBP. The sample provided the first draft [[genome]] from the [[cell nucleus]] of a Pleistocene [[carnivore]] and the sequence was identified as belonging to ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=skoglund2015/> The sequence indicated that the Taimyr-1 lineage was separate to modern wolves and dogs. Using the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date in addition to its genome sequence compared to that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the mutation rate in dogs and wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The study indicated that the Taimyr-1 population, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000-40,000 years ago. Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000 YBP, as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas.<ref name=skoglund2015/>

The study proposed that the timing of this separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=skoglund2015/>{{rp|page3}}<ref name=nature2015/>

===Place of divergence===
Where the [[genetic divergence]] of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=machugh2016/> Central Asia,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=shannon2015/> and East Asia.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=wang2015/> This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=grimm2016/>

In 2007, a study of maternal [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] sequences from dogs and wolves indicated that their [[haplotype]]s resolved into four [[monophyletic]] [[clades]] (a grouping that includes its ancestor), of which two clades showed a strong relationship between dogs and the wolves of Europe.<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=schleidt1998/>

'''South East Asia:'''
In 2009, a study of the maternal [[mitochondrial genome]] indicated the origin in south-eastern Asia south of the [[Yangtze River]] as more dog [[haplogroups]] had been found there.<ref name=pang2009/> Paternal [[Y-chromosome]] DNA sequences indicated the south-western part of south-eastern Asia that is south of the Yangtze River (comprising [[South-East Asia]] and the Chinese provinces of [[Yunnan]] and [[Guangxi]]) because of the greater diversity of [[yDNA]] haplogroups found in that region.<ref name=ding2011/> A criticism of this proposal is that no wolf remains have been found in this region and the earliest archaeological evidence of a dog dates to only 4,700 YBP.<ref name=larson2012/>

'''Middle East:''' In 2010, a study using [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s indicated that dogs originated in the Middle East due to the greater sharing of haplotypes between dogs and Middle Eastern gray wolves, else there may have been significant admixture between some regional breeds and regional wolves.<ref name=vonholdt2010/> In 2011, a study found that there had been dog-wolf [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and not an independent domestication.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=ardalan2011/>

'''East Asia:''' In 2002, a study of maternal [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] indicated that the dog diverged from its ancestor in East Asia because there were more dog mDNA haplotypes found there than in other parts of the world,<ref name=savolainen2002/> but this was rebutted because village dogs in Africa also show a similar haplotype diversity.<ref name=boyko2009/> In 2015, a [[whole genome sequencing|whole genome analysis]] of modern dog and wolf sequences concluded that based on the genetic diversity of today's East Asian dogs, the dog had originated in southern East Asia, followed by a migration of a subset of ancestral dogs 15,000 YBP towards the Middle East, Africa and Europe and reaching Europe 10,000 YBP. Then, one of these lineages migrated back to northern China and admixed with endemic Asian lineages before migrating to the Americas.<ref name=wang2015/> A criticism of this proposal is that no dog remains date beyond 12,000 YBP in this region but date to 14,000 YBP in western Europe, however it is accepted that archaeological studies in the Far East are generally lagging behind those in Europe.<ref name=larson2012/>

'''Central Asia:''' In 2015, a study looked at 85,805 [[genetic marker]]s of [[Autosome|autosomal]], maternal [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genome]] and paternal [[Y chromosome]] diversity in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. Some dog populations in the [[Neotropics]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] are almost completely derived from European stock, and other regions show clear admixture between indigenous and European dogs. The indigenous dog populations of Vietnam, India, and Egypt show minimal evidence of European admixture, and exhibit indicators consistent with a [[Central Asia]]n domestication origin, followed by a population expansion in East Asia. The study could not rule out the possibility that dogs were domesticated elsewhere and subsequently arrived in and diversified from Central Asia. Studies of extant dogs cannot exclude the possibility of earlier domestication events that subsequently died out or were overwhelmed by more modern populations.<ref name=shannon2015/>

'''No agreement using modern DNA:''' In 2016, a whole-genome study of wolves and dogs concluded that admixture had confounded the ability to make inferences about the place of dog domestication. Past studies based on [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]],<ref name=vonholdt2010/> genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves,<ref name=wang2015/> and lower [[linkage disequilibrium]]<ref name=shannon2015/> might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that the analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.<ref name=fan2016/>

====Using ancient DNA====
[[File:Kesslerloch Cave dog 14,500.jpg|thumb|right|The 14,500-year-old upper-right jaw of a [[Pleistocene]] wolf found in Kesslerloch Cave, [[Switzerland]], is the sister to 2/3 of modern dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> (courtesy Hannes Napierala)]]

In his 1868 book on ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication|Variation under Domestication]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] assessed the arguments for single or multiple origins of dogs, and noted the paleontological research of [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|de Blainville]] who proposed that dogs were descended from a single extinct species.<ref name=darwin1868/> In 1934, an eminent paleontologist indicated that the ancestor of the dog lineage may have been the extinct ''[[Canis lupus variabilis]]''.<ref name=pei1934/> In 1950, a morphological study of Japanese prehistoric dogs compared to extant wolves concluded: ""Therefore the living wolf kinds have nothing to do with the ancestral forms of the prehistoric dog races.""<ref name=hasebe1950/> In 1999, a study emphasized that while molecular genetic data seem to support the origin of dogs from wolves, dogs may have descended from a now [[extinction|extinct]] [[species]] of canid whose closest living relative was the wolf.<ref name=wayne1999/> The dog's lineage may have been contributed to from a [[ghost population]]. The advent of rapid and inexpensive [[DNA sequencing]] technology has made it possible to significantly increase the resolving power of genetic data taken from both modern and ancient domestic dog genomes. Attention was now turned to studies based on [[ancient DNA]] from fossil canids.<ref name=larson2012/>

'''Europe:''' In 2013, a study analysed the complete and partial [[Nuclear DNA#Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genome]] sequences of 18 fossil canids dated from 1,000 to 36,000 YBP from the Old and New Worlds, and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from modern wolves and dogs. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis showed that modern dog [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] [[haplotype]]s resolve into four [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clades]] with strong statistical support, and these have been designated by researchers as [[#Dog-Wolf hybridization|clades A-D]].<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1997/><ref name=bjornerfeldt2006/> Based on the specimens used in this study, clade A included 64% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to a 14,500 YBP wolf sequence from the Kesserloch cave in Switzerland, with a most recent common ancestor estimated to 32,100 YBP. This group of dogs matched three fossil pre-Columbian New World dogs dated between 1,000 and 8,500 YBP, which supported the hypothesis that pre-Columbian dogs in the New World share ancestry with modern dogs and that they likely arrived with the first humans to the New World. Clade B included 22% of the dog sequences and was related to modern wolves from Sweden and the Ukraine, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 9,200 YBP. However, this relationship might represent mitochondrial genome [[introgression]] from wolves because dogs were domesticated by this time. Clade C included 12% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to two ancient dogs from the [[Oberkassel, Bonn|Bonn-Oberkassel]] cave (14,700 YBP) and the Kartstein cave (12,500 YBP) near [[Mechernich]] in Germany, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 16,000–24,000 YBP. Clade D contained sequences from 2 [[Scandinavia]]n breeds ([[Jamthund]],
[[Norwegian Elkhound]]) and were sister to an ancient wolf-like canid from Switzerland, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 18,300 YBP. Its branch is phylogenetically rooted in the same sequence as the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog &ndash; 33,000 BP|""Altai dog""]]  (not a direct ancestor). The data from this study indicated a European origin for dogs that was estimated at 18,800–32,100 years ago based on the genetic relationship of 78% of the sampled dogs with ancient canid specimens found in Europe.<ref name=thalmann2013/> The data supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture<ref name=vila1997/> and was initiated close to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] when hunter-gatherers preyed on [[megafauna]].<ref name=thalmann2013/>

The study found that three ancient Belgium canids (the 36,000 YBP [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog – 36,000 YBP|""Goyet dog""]] cataloged as ''Canis'' species, along with Belgium 30,000 YBP and 26,000 years YBP cataloged as ''Canis lupus'') formed an ancient clade that was the most divergent group. The study found that the skulls of the ""Goyet dog"" and the ""Altai dog"" had some dog-like characteristics and proposed that the may have represented an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs<ref name=thalmann2013/> as there was for domestic pigs.<ref name=frantz2015/>

A criticism of the European proposal is that dogs in East Asia show more genetic diversity. However, dramatic differences in genetic diversity can be influenced both by an ancient and recent history of inbreeding.<ref name=wang2015/> A counter-comment is that the modern European breeds only emerged in the 19th century, and that throughout history global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>

'''Arctic North-East Siberia:''' In 2015, a study looked at the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one [[Canis lupus variabilis|''Canis c.f. variabilis'']] dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the [[Yana River]] was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct [[Japanese wolf]]. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'' (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP – the ""Goyet dog""), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the [[progenitor]] (including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'') to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to ''C. variabilis'', and the genetic contribution of ''C. variabilis'' to the dog, is the subject of debate.<ref name=lee2015/>

The [[Zhokhov Island]] (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with – or are one mutation away from – the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''C. l. chanco'') and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (''C. l. hodophilax''). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from [[Silene stenophylla#Duvanny Yar|Duvanny Yar]] appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.<ref name=lee2015/>

====Archaeological evidence====
Domesticated dogs are more clearly identified when they are associated with human occupation, and those interred side-by-side with human remains provide the most conclusive evidence,<ref name=boudadi2014/> (refer to the table below – 14,708 YBP Bonn-Oberkassel dog).

====Newgrange dog &ndash; two domestication events====
In 2009, a study looked at the two earliest dog skulls that had been found at Eliseevich 1 in comparison to other much earlier but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe and concluded that the earlier specimens were ""[[Paleolithic dog]]s"", which were morphologically and genetically distinct from Pleistocene wolves that lived in Europe at that time. These also include the 36,000-year-old ""Goyet dog"" and the 33,000-year-old ""Altai dog"".<ref name=germonpre2009/>
{{further information|Paleolithic dog}}

Later studies suggested that it was possible for multiple primitive forms of the dog to have existed, including in Europe.<ref name=wang2015/> European dog populations had undergone extensive turnover during the last 15,000 years that has erased the genomic signature of early European dogs,<ref name=shannon2015/><ref name=malmstrom2008/> the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture,<ref name=larson2012/> and there was the possibility of past domestication events that had gone extinct or had been largely replaced by more modern dog populations.<ref name=shannon2015/>

In 2016, a study compared the [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome sequences]] of a world-wide panel of modern dogs, the mDNA sequences of 59 ancient European dog specimens dated 14,000-3,000 YBP, and the [[nuclear genome]] sequence of a dog specimen that was found in the [[Late Neolithic]] passage grave at [[Newgrange]], [[Ireland]] and [[radiocarbon dated]] at 4,800 YBP. A genetic analysis of the Newgrange dog showed that it was male, did not possess genetic variants associated with modern coat length nor color, was unable to process starch as efficiently as modern dogs but more efficiently than wolves, and showed ancestry from a population of wolves that could not be found in other dogs nor wolves today.<ref name=frantz2016/> As the taxonomic classification of the ""proto-dog"" [[Paleolithic dog]]s as being either dogs or wolves remains controversial, they were excluded from the study.<ref name=frantz2016/>{{rp|Sup}} The [[phylogenetic tree]] generated from mDNA sequences found a deep division between the [[Sarloos wolfdog]] and all other dogs, indicating that breed's recent deriving from the [[German Shepherd]] and captive gray wolves. The next largest division was between Eastern Asian dogs and Western Eurasian (Europe and the Middle East) dogs that had occurred between 14,000-6,400 YBP, with the Newgrange dog clustering with the Western Eurasian dogs. The northern breed [[Greenland dog]] and the [[Siberian husky]] were poorly supported in the tree, possibly indicating mixed ancestry.<ref name=frantz2015/> (See also [[#Taimyr wolf admixture|Taimyr wolf admixture]])

The Newgrange and ancient European dog mDNA sequences could be largely assigned to mDNA haplogroups [[#Dog-Wolf hybridization|C and D]]  but modern European dog sequences could be largely assigned to mDNA haplogroups A and B, indicating a turnover of dogs in the past from a place other than Europe. As this split dates older than the Newgrange dog this suggests that the replacement was only partial. The analysis showed that most modern European dogs had undergone a [[population bottleneck]] which can be an indicator of travel. The archaeological record shows dog remains dating over 15,000 YBP in Western Eurasia, over 12,500 YBP in Eastern Eurasia, but none older than 8,000 YBP in Central Asia. The study proposed that dogs may have been domesticated separately in both Eastern and Western Eurasia from two genetically distinct and now extinct wolf populations. East Eurasian dogs then made their way with migrating people to Western Europe between 14,000-6,400 YBP where they partially replaced the dogs of Europe.<ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=vonholdt2016/> Two domestication events in Western Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia has recently been found for the domestic pig.<ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=frantz2015/>

The hypothesis proposed is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves. These were then domesticated independently before becoming extinct. The Western Eurasian dog population was then partially and gradually replaced by Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6400 years ago.<ref name=frantz2016/> A single domestication is thought to be due to chance, however dual domestication on different sides of the world is unlikely to have happened randomly and it suggests that external factors - an environmental driver - may have forced wolves to work together with humans for survival. It is possible that wolves took advantage of resources that humans had, or humans may have been introduced to wolves in an area in which they didn’t previously live.<ref name=chan2016/>

The study used the radiocarbon age of the Newgrange dog to calibrate the mutation rate for dogs, which was similar to that calculated for the Late Pleistocene [[Origin of the domestic dog#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolf]]. Comparing the sequence of the Newgrange dog using this mutation rate with two modern wolves from Russia gave a divergence time between 20,000-60,000 YBP. However, these two modern wolves may not have been closely related to the population that gave rise to the dog, which may have diverged from their ancestor at a later time.<ref name=frantz2016/>

==Dog domestication==
{{main article|Domestication of animals}}
[[File:Men of the old stone age (1915) Wolf.png|thumb|right|[[Watercolor]] tracing made by archaeologist [[Henri Breuil]] from a [[cave painting]] of a wolf-like canid, [[Font-de-Gaume]], France dated 19,000 years ago.]]

The domestication of animals is the [[scientific theory]] of the mutual relationship between animals with the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction.<ref name=zeder2015/> [[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/> ""The dog"", according to Oxford researcher Greger Larsen, ""was the first domesticant. Without dogs you don't have any other domestication. You don't have civilization.""<ref name=grimm2015/>

There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or [[Landrace|regional populations]].<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=meyer2013/> The dog was the first domesticant and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/>

{{Further information|Domestication of animals#Definitions}}

===Time of domestication===
An [[apex predator]] is a predator that sits on the top [[trophic level]] of the food chain, while a [[mesopredator]] sits further down the food chain and is dependent on smaller animals. Towards the end of the Pleistocene era, most of today's apex predators were mesopredators and this included the wolf. During the ecological upheaval associated with the close of the Late Pleistocene, one type of wolf population rose to become today's apex predator and another joined with humans to become an apex consumer.<ref name=morey2016/>

{{further|Mesopredator release hypothesis}}

In August 2015, a study undertook an analysis of the complete [[mitogenome]] sequences of 555 modern and ancient dogs. The sequences showed an increase in the population size approximately 23,500 YBP, which broadly coincides with the proposed separation of the ancestors of dogs and present-day wolves before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (refer [[Origin of the domestic dog#Time of divergence|first divergence]]). A ten-fold increase in the population size occurred after 15,000 YBP, which may be attributable to domestication events and is consistent with the demographic dependence of dogs on the human population (refer [[Origin of the domestic dog#Archaeological evidence|archaeological evidence]]).<ref name=duleba2015/>

===Commensal pathway===
[[File:Dog morphological variation.png|thumb|Montage showing the morphological variation of the dog.]]
Animal domestication is a [[coevolution]]ary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel [[Ecological niche|niche]] that included another species with evolving behaviors.<ref name=larson2014/>

:''See further: [[Origin of the domestic dog#Convergent evolution between dogs and humans|Convergent evolution between dogs and humans]]''

The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a [[Commensalism|commensal]] pathway into domestication. The dog was the first domesticant, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the [[Pleistocene]], well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/> It may have been inevitable that the first domesticated animal came from the order of carnivores as these are less afraid when approaching other species. Within the carnivores, the first domesticated animal would need to exist without an all-meat diet, possess a running and hunting ability to provide its own food, and be of a controllable size to coexist with humans, indicating the family ''Canidae'', and the right temperament<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p166}} with wolves being among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet.<ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=waal2006/>

:''See further: [[Domestication of animals#Commensal pathway|Commensal pathway]]''

[[Ancient DNA]] supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1997/> and was initiated close to the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on [[megafauna]], and when proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites.<ref name=thalmann2013/> Wolves were probably attracted to human campfires by the smell of meat being cooked and discarded refuse in the vicinity, first loosely attaching themselves and then considering these as part of their home territory where their warning growls would alert humans to the approach of outsiders.<ref name=olsen1985/> The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication.<ref name=zeder2012/> The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/><ref name=morey1992/> and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth,<ref name=turnbull1974/><ref name=zeder2012/> which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression.<ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=trut1999/> This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=zeder2012/>

A maternal [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial]], paternal [[Y chromosome]], and [[Microsatellite#Analysis of microsatellites|microsatellite]] assessment of two wolf populations in North America and combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou, and another territorial [[ecotype]] population that remained in a [[Taiga|boreal]] coniferous forest. Though these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=musiani2007/> A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]] with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist [[megafauna]] hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=leonard2007/> Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=wolpert2013/>

Even today, the wolves on [[Ellesmere Island]] do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little, and they will approach humans cautiously, curiously and closely.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-syB6DSQlvQC&pg=PA7 Arctic Wolf: The High Arctic] by Laura DeLallo.

===Post-domestication gene flow===
Some studies have found greater diversity in the genetic markers of dogs from East<ref name=wang2015/><ref name=pang2009/> and Central<ref name=shannon2015/> Asia compared to Europe and have concluded that dogs originated from these regions, despite no archaeological evidence to support the conclusions.<ref name=larson2012/> One reason for these discrepancies is the sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000 years, which has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs.<ref name=larson2012/> Another reason is that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the [[Pleistocene]] wolves that were first domesticated.<ref name=freedman2014/> In other words, the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.<ref name=larson2014/>

[[Phylogenetic]] analysis shows that modern dog [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] [[haplotype]]s resolve into four [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clades]] with strong statistical support, and these have been designated by researchers as clades A-D.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1997/><ref name=bjornerfeldt2006/> Other studies that included a wider sample of specimens have reported two rare East Asian clades E-F with weaker statistical support.<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=savolainen2002/><ref name=duleba2015/> In 2009, a study found that [[haplogroups]] A, B and C included 98% of dogs and are found universally distributed across Eurasia, indicating that they were the result of a single domestication event, and that haplogroups D, E, and F were rare and appeared to be the result of regional hybridization with local wolves post-domestication. Haplogroups A and B contained subclades that appeared to be the result of hybridization with wolves post-domestication, because each haplotype within each of these subclades was the result of a female wolf/male dog pairing.<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/>

'''Haplogroup A:''' Includes 64-65% of dogs.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=duleba2015/> Haplotypes of subclades a2–a6 are derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization.<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/>

'''Haplogroup B:''' Includes 22-23% of dogs.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=duleba2015/> haplotypes of subclade b2 are derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization.<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/>

'''Haplogroup C:''' Includes 10-12% of dogs.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=duleba2015/>

'''Haplogroup D:''' Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in subclade d1 (Scandinavia) and d2 (South-West Asia).<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/> The northern Scandinavian subclade d1 hybrid haplotypes originated 480-3,000 YBP and are found in all [[Sami people|Sami]]-related breeds: [[Finnish Lapphund]], [[Swedish Lapphund]], [[Lapponian Herder]], [[Jamthund]], [[Norwegian Elkhound]] and [[Hällefors Elkhound]]. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to them has not been matched across Eurasia<ref name=klutsch2010/> and its branch is phylogenetically rooted in the same sequence as the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Altai dog &ndash; 33,000 BP|Altai dog]] (not a direct ancestor).<ref name=thalmann2013/>  The subclade d2 hybrid haplotypes are found in 2.6% of South-West Asian dogs.<ref name=ardalan2011/>

'''Haplogroup E:''' Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in East Asia,<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/> (rare distribution in South-East Asia, Korea and Japan).<ref name=ardalan2011/>

'''Haplogroup F:''' Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in Japan.<ref name=pang2009/><ref name=duleba2015/> A study of 600 dog specimens found only one dog whose sequence indicated hybridization with the extinct [[Honshu Wolf|Japanese wolf]].<ref name=ishiguro2009/>

It is not known whether this hybridization was the result of humans selecting for [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits from local wolf populations<ref name=bjornerfeldt2006/> or the result of natural [[introgression]] as the dog expanded across Eurasia.<ref name=larson2012/>

[[File:Greenland Dog.jpg|thumb|The [[Greenland dog]] carries 3.5% shared genetic material with the 35,000 years BP Taymyr wolf specimen.]]

====Taimyr wolf admixture====
In May 2015, a study compared the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 wolf lineage to that of dogs and gray wolves.

Comparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000 years ago but before the inundation of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=skoglund2015/>{{rp|21}}

A comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (i.e. gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes - the [[Siberian husky]] and [[Greenland dog]] that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the [[Shar Pei]] and [[Finnish spitz]]. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This [[introgression]] could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref name=skoglund2015/>{{rp|3–4}}

An attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.<ref name=skoglund2015/>{{rp|23}}

As the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000 years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000 and 60,000 YBP. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.<ref name=machugh2016/>

===Positive selection===
[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|right|Reduction in size under domestication - grey wolf and chihuahua skulls.]]

[[Charles Darwin]] recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=larson2014b/> Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.

Although it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 [[Dmitry Belyayev (zoologist)|Dmitry Belyayev]] tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing.<ref name=trut1999/><ref name=larson2013/><ref name=trut2009/> In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer2005/> Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for [[mink]]<ref name=malmkvist2002/> and [[Japanese quail]].<ref name=jones1997/> In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.<ref name=larson2013/>

The genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=meyer2013/> A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from [[positive selection]] resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues.<ref name=larson2014/>  A study published in 2016 suggested that there have been negative genetic consequences of the domestication process as well, that enrichment of disease-related gene variants accompanied positively selected traits.<ref name=marsden2016/>

In 2010, a study identified 51 regions of the dog genome that were associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits studied, which included body, cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size. There were 3 [[Quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] that explained most of the phenotypic variation. Indicators of recent selection were shown by many of the 51 genomic regions that were  associated with traits that define a breed, which include body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness.<ref name=boyko2010/>  Geneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=cieslak2011/> Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed the correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=ludwig2009/> Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=fang2009/> Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.<ref name=larson2013/><ref name=hemmer1990/>

In 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct [[ghost population]] of wild pigs during the [[Pleistocene]]. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.<ref name=frantz2015/><ref name=pennisi2015/>

In 2014, a whole genome study of the DNA differences between wolves and dogs found that dogs did not show a reduced fear response but did show greater [[synaptic plasticity]]. Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the cellular correlate of learning and memory, and this change may have altered the learning and memory abilities of dogs in comparison to wolves.<ref name=li2014/>

====Behavior====
Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=serpell2014/><ref name=cagan2016/> In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. There was evidence of selection during dog domestication of genes that affect the [[Epinephrine#Mechanism of action|adrenaline]] and [[Neuromodulation|noradrenaline]] [[biosynthesis]] pathway. These genes are involved in the synthesis, transport and degradation of a variety of neurotransmitters, particularly the [[catecholamine]]s, which include [[dopamine]] and [[noradrenaline]]. Recurrent selection on this pathway and its role in emotional processing and the fight-or-flight response<ref name=cagan2016/><ref name=almada2015/> suggests that the behavioral changes we see in dogs compared to wolves may be due to changes in this pathway, leading to tameness and an emotional processing ability.<ref name=cagan2016/> Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves.<ref name=cagan2016/><ref name=coppinger1995/> Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.<ref name=cagan2016/>

====Dietary adaption====
[[File:Dog size variation.png|thumb|The difference in overall body size between a [[Cane Corso]] (Italian mastiff) and a [[Yorkshire terrier]] is over 30-fold, yet both are members of the same species.]]
[[AMY2B]] (Alpha-Amylase 2B) is a gene that codes a protein that assists with the first step in the digestion of dietary [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]. An expansion of this gene in dogs would enable early dogs to exploit a starch-rich diet as they fed on refuse from agriculture.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=cagan2016/> In a study in 2014, the data indicated that the wolves and dingo had just two copies of the gene and the Siberian Husky that is associated with hunter-gatherers had just three or four copies, whereas the [[Saluki]] that is associated with the [[Fertile Crescent]] where agriculture originated had 29 copies. The results show that on average, modern dogs have a high copy number of the gene, whereas wolves and dingoes do not. The high copy number of AMY2B variants likely already existed as a standing variation in early domestic dogs, but expanded more recently with the development of large agriculturally based civilizations. This suggests that at the beginning of the domestication process, dogs may have been characterized by a more [[carnivorous]] diet than their modern-day counterparts, a diet held in common with early hunter-gatherers.<ref name=freedman2014/> A later study indicated that because most dogs had a high copy number of the AMY2B gene but the arctic breeds and the [[dingo]] did not, that the dog's dietary change may not have been caused by initial domestication but by the subsequent spread of agriculture to most - but not all - regions of the planet.<ref name=arendt2016/>

In 2016, a study of the dog [[genome]] compared to the wolf genome looked for genes that showed signs of having undergone positive selection. The study identified genes relating to brain function and behavior, and to [[lipid]] metabolism. This ability to process lipids indicates a dietary target of selection that was important when proto-dogs hunted and fed alongside hunter-gatherers. The evolution of the dietary metabolism genes may have helped process the increased lipid content of early dog diets as they scavenged on the remains of carcasses left by hunter-gatherers.<ref name=freedman2016/> Prey capture rates may have increased in comparison to wolves and with it the amount of lipid consumed by the assisting proto-dogs.<ref name=freedman2016/><ref name=shipman2015/><ref name=shipman2015b/> A unique dietary selection pressure may have evolved both from the amount consumed, and the shifting composition of, tissues that were available to proto-dogs once humans had removed the most desirable parts of the carcass for themselves.<ref name=freedman2016/> A study of the mammal biomass during modern human expansion into the northern [[Mammoth steppe]] found that it had occurred under conditions of unlimited resources, and that many of the animals were killed with only a small part consumed or left unused.<ref name=zimov2012/>

===Natural selection===
Dogs can infer the name of an object and have been shown to learn the names of over 1,000 objects. Dogs can follow the human pointing gesture; even nine-week-old puppies can follow a basic human pointing gesture without being taught. [[New Guinea singing dog]]s, a half-wild proto-dog endemic to the remote alpine regions of [[New Guinea]], as well as [[dingo]]es in the remote [[Outback]] of Australia are also capable of this. These examples demonstrate an ability to read human gestures that arose early in domestication and did not require human selection. ""Humans did not develop dogs, we only fine-tuned them down the road.""<ref name=hareb2013/>{{rp|92}}

:''See further:'' [[Dog intelligence#Learning by inference|Dog learning by inference]]

A dog's cranium is 15% smaller than an equally heavy wolf's, and the dog is less aggressive and more playful. Other species pairs show similar differences. [[Bonobo]]s, like [[chimpanzee]]s, are a close genetic cousin to humans, but unlike the chimpanzees, bonobos are not aggressive and do not participate in lethal inter-group aggression or kill within their own group. The most distinctive features of a bonobo are its cranium, which is 15% smaller than a chimpanzee's, and its less aggressive and more playful behavior. In other examples, the [[guinea pig]]'s cranium is 13% smaller than its wild cousin the [[cavy]], and domestic fowl show a similar reduction to their wild cousins. Possession of a smaller cranium for holding a smaller brain is a telltale sign of domestication. Bonobos appear to have domesticated themselves.<ref name=hareb2013/>{{rp|104}} In the farm fox experiment, humans selectively bred foxes against aggression, causing domestication syndrome. The foxes were not selectively bred for smaller craniums and teeth, floppy ears, or skills at using human gestures, but these traits were demonstrated in the friendly foxes. Natural selection favors those that are the most successful at reproducing, not the most aggressive. Selection against aggression made possible the ability to cooperate and communicate among foxes, dogs and bonobos. Perhaps it did the same thing for humans.<ref name=hareb2013/>{{rp|114}}<ref name=hare2005/> The more docile animals have been found to have less testosterone than their more aggressive counterparts, and testosterone controls aggression and brain size. One researcher has argued that in becoming more social, we humans have developed a smaller brain than those of humans 20,000 years ago.<ref name=hood2014/>

===Convergent evolution between dogs and humans===
As a result of the domestication process there is also evidence of [[convergent evolution]] having occurred between dogs and humans.<ref name=hareb2013/> The history of the two is intertwined:
{{Quote|''Remove domestication from the human species, and there’s probably a couple of million of us on the planet, max. Instead, what do we have? Seven billion people, climate change, travel, innovation and everything. Domestication has influenced the entire earth. And dogs were the first. For most of human history, we’re not dissimilar to any other wild primate. We’re manipulating our environments, but not on a scale bigger than, say, a herd of African elephants. And then, we go into partnership with this group of wolves. They altered our relationship with the natural world.''|Greger Larson |<ref name=yong2016/> }}
[[File:Dog coat variation.png|thumb|Montage showing the coat variation of the dog.]]

====Biological evidence====
In 2007, a study found that dog domestication was accompanied by selection at three genes with key roles in starch digestion: AMY2B, MGAMand SGLT1, and was a striking case of parallel evolution when coping with an increasingly starch-rich diet caused similar adaptive responses in dogs and humans.<ref name=perry2007/><ref name=axelsson2013/>

In 2013, a DNA sequencing study indicated that [[parallel evolution]] in humans and dogs is most apparent in the genes for digestion and metabolism, neurological processes, and cancer, likely as a result of shared selection pressures.<ref name=wang2013/><ref name=cossins2013/>

In 2014, a study compared the [[hemoglobin]] levels of village dogs and people on the Chinese lowlands with those on the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. It found the hemoglobin levels higher for both people and dogs in Tibet, suggesting that Tibetan dogs might share similar adaptive strategies as the Tibetan people. A population genetic analysis then showed a significant convergence between humans and dogs in Tibet.<ref name=wang2014/> Like the Tibetan people, [[Tibetan mastiff]]s appear to have derived these benefits partially from the [[EPAS1]] gene, acquired through [[introgression]].<ref name=""miao2016""/>

In 2015, a study found that when dogs and their owners interact, extended [[eye contact]] (mutual [[gaze]]) increases [[oxytocin]] levels in both the dog and its owner. As oxytocin is known for its role in [[maternal bond]]ing, it is considered likely that this effect has supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding.<ref name=nagsawa2015/> One observer has stated, ""The dog could have arisen only from animals predisposed to human society by lack of fear, attentiveness, curiosity, necessity, and recognition of advantage gained through collaboration....the humans and wolves involved in the conversion were [[sentient]], observant beings constantly making decisions about how they lived and what they did, based on the perceived ability to obtain at a given time and place what they needed to survive and thrive. They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined. Powerful emotions were in play that many observers today refer to as [[love]] – boundless, unquestioning love.""<ref name=derr2011/>

====Behavioral evidence====
[[Convergent evolution]] is when distantly related species independently evolve similar solutions to the same problem. For example, fish, [[penguin]]s and [[dolphin]]s have each separately evolved [[flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] as a solution to the problem of moving through the water. What has been found between dogs and humans is something less frequently demonstrated: psychological convergence. Dogs have independently evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans than we are to our closest genetic relatives.<ref name=hareb2013/>{{rp|60}} Dogs have evolved specialized skills for reading human social and communicative behavior. These skills seem more flexible – and possibly more human-like – than those of other animals more closely related to humans phylogenetically, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other [[great ape]]s. This raises the possibility that convergent evolution has occurred: both ''Canis familiaris'' and ''Homo sapiens'' might have evolved some similar (although obviously not identical) social-communicative skills – in both cases adapted for certain kinds of social and communicative interactions with human beings.<ref name=hare2005/>

The pointing gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is a foundation building-block of [[human communication]]. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word.<ref name=butterworth2003/> In 2009, a study compared the responses to a range of pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.<ref name=lakatos2009/>

Later studies support [[coevolution]] in that dogs can discriminate the emotional expressions of human faces,<ref name=muller2015/> and that most people can tell from a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive,<ref name=hare2013/> and can tell from a growl how big the dog is.<ref name=sanderson2008/>

====Human adoption of some wolf behaviors====
''""Isn't it strange that, our being such an intelligent primate, we didn't domesticate chimpanzees as companions instead? Why did we choose wolves even though they are strong enough to maim or kill us?""''<ref name=schleidt2003/>

[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|right|Bison surrounded by gray wolf pack]]
In 2002, a study proposed that immediate human ancestors and wolves may have domesticated each other through a strategic alliance that would change both respectively into humans and dogs. The effects of human psychology, hunting practices, [[territoriality]] and social behavior would have been profound.<ref name=tacon2002/> Wolves and dogs mark their territory with scent; however, humans do not have a keen sense of smell and may have begun to mark their territories with symbols, which became the first art and may have been generative of human culture.<ref name=tacon2002/><ref name=lynn2002/> Wolves hunt large game; however, there is no evidence of pre-''sapiens'' hunting large game. Early humans moved from scavenging and small-game hunting to big-game hunting by living in larger, socially more-complex groups, learning to hunt in packs, and developing powers of cooperation and negotiation in complex situations. As these are characteristics of wolves, dogs and humans, it can be argued that these behaviors were enhanced once wolves and humans began to cohabit. Communal hunting led to communal defense. Wolves actively patrol and defend their scent-marked territory, and perhaps humans had their sense of territoriality enhanced by living with wolves.<ref name=tacon2002/> One of the keys to recent human survival has been the forming partnerships. Strong bonds exist between same-sex wolves, dogs and humans and these bonds are stronger than exist between other same-sex animal pairs. Today, the most widespread form of inter-species bonding occurs between humans and dogs. The concept of friendship has ancient origins but it may have been enhanced through the inter-species relationship to give a survival advantage.<ref name=tacon2002/><ref name=grandin2005/>

In 2003, a study compared the behavior and ethics of chimpanzees, wolves and humans. Cooperation among humans' closest genetic relative is limited to occasional hunting episodes or the persecution of a competitor for personal advantage, which had to be tempered if humans were to become domesticated.<ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=kirkpatrick2014/> The closest approximation to human morality that can be found in nature is that of the gray wolf, ''Canis lupus''. Wolves are among the most gregarious and cooperative of animals on the planet,<ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=waal2006/> and their ability to cooperate in well-coordinated drives to hunt prey, carry items too heavy for an individual, provisioning not only their own young but also the other pack members, babysitting etc. are rivaled only by that of human societies. Similar forms of cooperation are observed in two closely related canids, the [[African wild dog]] and the Asian [[dhole]], therefore it is reasonable to assume that canid sociality and cooperation are old traits that in terms of evolution predate human sociality and cooperation. Today's wolves may even be less social than their ancestors, as they have lost access to big herds of [[ungulate]]s and now tend more toward a lifestyle similar to coyotes, jackals, and even foxes.<ref name=schleidt2003/> Social sharing within families may be a trait that early humans learned from wolves,<ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=fogg2015/> and with wolves digging dens long before humans constructed huts it is not clear who domesticated whom.<ref name=schleidt1998/><ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=kirkpatrick2014/>

On the [[mammoth steppe]] the wolf's ability to hunt in packs, to share risk fairly among pack members, and to cooperate moved them to the top of the [[food chain]] above lions, hyenas and bears. Some wolves followed the great [[reindeer]] herds, eliminating the unfit, the weaklings, the sick and the aged, and therefore improved the herd. These wolves had become the first pastoralists hundreds of thousands of years before humans also took to this role.<ref name=schleidt1998/> The wolves' advantage over their competitors was that they were able to keep pace with the herds, move fast and enduringly, and make the most efficient use of their kill by their ability to ""wolf down"" a large part of their quarry before other predators had detected the kill. The study proposed that during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], some of our ancestors teamed up with those pastoralist wolves and learned their techniques.<ref name=schleidt2003/><ref name=brown2005/> Many of our ancestors remained gatherers and scavengers, or specialized as fish-hunters, hunter-gatherers, and hunter-gardeners. However, some ancestors adopted the pastoralist wolves' lifestyle as herd followers and herders of reindeer, horses, and other hoofed animals. They harvested the best stock for themselves while the wolves kept the herd strong, and this group of humans was to become the first herders and this group of wolves was to become the first dogs.<ref name=schleidt1998/><ref name=schleidt2003/>

==First dogs as a hunting technology==
[[File:The wolf's family portrait.tif|thumb|right|300px|The wolf's family portrait reveals a diversity of form among breeds of domestic dogs.]]
During the late Paleolithic, the increase in human population density, advances in blade and hunting technology, and climate change may have altered prey densities and made scavenging crucial to the survival of some wolf populations. Adaptations to scavenging such as tameness, small body size, and a decreased age of reproduction would reduce their hunting efficiency further, eventually leading to obligated scavenging.<ref name=shannon2015/><ref name=coppinger2015/> Whether these earliest dogs were simply human-commensal scavengers or they played some role as companions or hunters that hastened their spread is unknown.<ref name=shannon2015/>

Researchers have proposed that in the past a hunting partnership existed between humans and dogs that was the basis for dog domestication.<ref name=davis1982/><ref name=clutton1984/><ref name=perri2016b/> The transition from the [[Late Pleistocene]] into the early [[Holocene]] was marked by climatic change from cold and dry to warmer, wetter conditions and rapid shifts in flora and fauna, with much of the open habitat of large herbivores being replaced by forests.<ref name=perri2016b/>  In the early [[Holocene]], it is proposed that along with changes in arrow-head technology that hunting dogs were used by hunters to track and retrieve wounded game in thick forests.<ref name=clutton1984/><ref name=perri2016b/> The dog's ability to chase, track, sniff out and hold prey can significantly increase the success of hunters in forests, where human senses and location skills are not as sharp as in more open habitats. Dogs are still used for hunting in forests today.<ref name=perri2016b/>

In Japan, temperate deciduous forests rapidly spread onto the main island of Honshu and caused an adaption away from hunting megafauna ([[Palaeoloxodon naumanni|Naumann’s elephant]] and Yabe’s giant deer) to hunting the quicker [[sika deer]] and [[wild boar]] in dense forest. With this came a change in hunting technology, including a shift to smaller, triangular points for arrows. A study of the [[Jōmon]] people that lived on the Pacific coast of [[Honshu]] during the early Holocene shows that they were conducting individual dog burials and were probably using dogs as tools for hunting sika deer and wild boar, as hunters in Japan still do today.<ref name=perri2016b/>

Hunting dogs make major contributions to forager societies and the ethnographic record shows them being given proper names, treated as family members, and considered separate to other types of dogs.<ref name=perri2016b/><ref name=ikeya1994/> This special treatment includes separate burials with markers and grave-goods,<ref name=perri2016b/><ref name=gron2007/><ref name=koler2007/> with those that were exceptional hunters or that were killed on the hunt often venerated.<ref name=perri2016b/><ref name=olowo1990/> A dog's value as a hunting partner gives them status as a living weapon and the most skilled elevated to taking on a ""personhood"", with their social position in life and in death similar to that of the skilled hunters.<ref name=perri2016b/><ref name=mizoguchi2002/>

Intentional dog burials together with ungulate hunting is also found in other early Holocene deciduous forest forager societies in Europe<ref name=bourque1975/> and North America,<ref name=larsson1990/><ref name=morey1992b/> indicating that across the [[Holarctic]] temperate zone hunting dogs were a widespread adaptation to forest ungulate hunting.<ref name=perri2016b/>

==First dog breeds==
[[File:Engagé mit einem indianischen Hundeschlitten by Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sled dog]] types, sketched in 1833]]

In 2017, a study showed that 9,000 YBP the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, however this area was connected to the mainland then. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is 20-25kg based on themo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between 16-25kg. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 YBP and in the modern [[Siberian husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at 30kg and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans and is thought to be for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>

The study proposes that after having diverged from the common ancestor along with the grey wolf, the evolution of ''Canis familiaris'' proceeded in three stages. The first was natural selection based on feeding behavior within the ecological niche that had been formed through human activity. The second was artificial selection based on tamability. The third was directed selection based on forming breeds that possessed qualities to help with specific tasks within the human economy. The process commenced 40,000-30,000 YBP with its speed increasing with each stage until domestication became complete.<ref name=pitulko2017/>

'''Cynophobia''' (from the {{lang-el|κύων}} ''kýōn'' ""dog"" and {{lang|el|φόβος}} ''phóbos'' ""fear"") is the fear of [[dog]]s. Cynophobia is classified as a [[specific phobia]], under the subtype ""[[animal phobia]]s"".<ref>{{harvp|Mavissakalian|Barlow|1981|p=2}}</ref> According to Dr. Timothy O. Rentz of the Laboratory for the Study of Anxiety Disorders at the [[University of Texas]], animal phobias are among the most common of the specific phobias and 36% of patients who seek treatment report being afraid of dogs or cats.<ref name=""Rentz"">{{harvp|Rentz|Powers|Smits|Cougle|2003|p=1338}}</ref> Although snakes and spiders are more common animal phobias, cynophobia is especially debilitating because of the high prevalence of dogs (for example, there are an estimated 25 million stray dogs in India,<ref name=""WHO"">{{cite web | url =http://www.who.int/features/2016/eliminating-rabies-india/en/ | title =Eliminating rabies in India through awareness, treatment and vaccination | date =September 2016 | website =World Health Organization | access-date=11 January 2017}}</ref> and an estimated 62 million pet dogs in the United States)<ref name=""Rentz""/> and the general ignorance of dog owners to the phobia. The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM-IV-TR'') reports that only 12% to 30% of those suffering from a specific phobia will seek treatment.<ref>[[#DSM|DSM-IV-TR (2000)]], p. 446.</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
The ''DSM-IV-TR'' provides the following criteria for the diagnosis of a specific phobia:<ref>[[#DSM|DSM-IV-TR (2000)]], p. 443.</ref>
:* the persistent fear of an object or situation
:* exposure to the feared object provokes an immediate [[anxiety]] response
:* adult patients recognize that the fear is excessive, unreasonable or irrational (this is not always the case with children)
:* exposure to the feared object is most often avoided altogether or is endured with dread
:* the fear interferes significantly with daily activities (social, familial, occupational, etc.)
:* minor patients (those under the age of 18) have symptoms lasting for at least six months
:* anxiety, [[panic attacks]] or avoidance cannot be accounted for by another mental disorder

The book ''Phobias'' defines a panic attack as ""a sudden terror lasting at least a few minutes with typical manifestations of intense fear"".<ref name=""Maj_6"">{{harvp|Maj|Akiskal|López-Ibor|Okasha|2004|p=6}}</ref> These manifestations may include palpitations, sweating, trembling, difficulty breathing, the urge to escape, faintness or dizziness, dry mouth, nausea and/or several other symptoms.<ref name=""Maj_6""/> As with other specific phobias, patients suffering from cynophobia may display a wide range of these reactions when confronted with a live dog or even when thinking about or presented with an image (static or filmed) of a dog.<ref name=""Maj_24"">{{harvp|Maj|Akiskal|López-Ibor|Okasha|2004|p=24}}</ref> Furthermore, classic avoidance behavior is also common and may include staying away from areas where dogs might be (i.e., a park), crossing the street to avoid a dog, or avoiding the homes of friends and/or family who own a dog.<ref name=""Maj_24""/>

== Cause ==

=== Age ===
Jeanette M. Bruce and William C. Sanderson, in their book ''Specific Phobias'', concluded that the age of onset for animal phobias is usually early childhood, between the ages of five and nine.<ref name=""Bruce_4"">{{harvp|Bruce|Sanderson|1998|p=4}}</ref> A study done in South Africa by Drs. Willem A. Hoffmann and Lourens H. Human further confirms this conclusion for patients suffering from cynophobia and additionally found dog phobia developing as late as age 20.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|p=34}}</ref>

=== Gender ===
Bruce and Sanderson also state that animal phobias are more common in females than males.<ref name=""Bruce_4""/> Furthermore, Dr. B.K. Wiederhold, a psychiatrist investigating [[virtual reality therapy]] as a possible method of therapy for anxiety disorders, goes on to provide data that although prevalent in both men and women, 75% to 90% of patients reporting specific phobias of the animal subtype are women.<ref>{{harvp|Wiederhold|2005|p=126}}</ref>

=== Acquisition ===
A current theory for fear acquisition presented by Dr. S. Rachman in 1977 maintains that there are three conditions by which fear is developed.<ref>{{harvp|Rachman|1977|p=375}}</ref> These include direct personal experience, observational experience, and informational or instructional experience. For example, direct personal experience consists of having a personal negative encounter with a dog such as being bitten. In contrast, seeing a friend attacked by a dog and thus developing a fear of dogs would be observational experience. Whereas both of these types of experiences involves a live dog, informational or instructional experience simply includes being told directly or indirectly (i.e., information read in a book, film, parental cues such as avoidance or dislike, etc.) that dogs are to be feared.

A study was conducted at the [[State University of New York]] to distinguish the significance of these three conditions upon the development of cynophobia.<ref>{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=241}}</ref> Thirty-seven women ages 18 to 21 were first screened into two groups: fearful of dogs and non-fearful of dogs.<ref name=""DiNardo_242"">{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=242}}</ref> Next, each woman was given a questionnaire which asked if she had ever had a frightening and/or painful confrontation with a dog, what her expectation was upon encountering a dog (pain, fear, etc.), and subjectively, what was the probability of that expectation actually occurring.<ref name=""DiNardo_242""/> The results indicated that, while non-fearful subjects had a different expectation of what would happen when encountering a dog, painful experiences with dogs were common among both groups; therefore, the study concluded that other factors must effect whether or not these painful experiences will develop into dog phobia.<ref>{{harvp|Di Nardo|Guzy|Jenkins|Bak|1988|p=243}}</ref>

Although Rachman's theory is the accepted model of fear acquisition, cases of cynophobia have been cited in which none of these three causes apply to the patient.<ref>{{harvp|Doogan|Thomas|1992|p=387}}</ref> In a speech given at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Dr. Arne Öhman proposed that animal fears in particular are likely to be an evolutionary remnant of the necessity ""to escape and to avoid becoming the prey of predators"".<ref>{{harvp|Öhman|1986|p=128}}</ref> Furthermore, in his book ''Overcoming Animal/Insect Phobias'', Dr. Martin Antony suggests that in the absence of Rachman's three causes, providing that the patient's memory is sound, biological factors may be a fourth cause of fear acquisition—meaning that the fear is inherited or is a throwback to an earlier genetic [[defense mechanism]].<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=30}}</ref> In any case, these causes may in actuality be a generalization of a complicated blend of both learning and [[genetics]].<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=31}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
The most common methods for the treatment of specific phobias are [[systematic desensitization]] and [[in vivo]] or [[exposure therapy]].

=== Systematic desensitization therapy ===
Systematic desensitization therapy was introduced by Joseph Wolpe in 1958 and employs relaxation techniques with imagined situations.<ref name=""Wiederhold_6"">{{harvp|Wiederhold|2005|p=6}}</ref> In a controlled environment, usually the therapist's office, the patient will be instructed to visualize a threatening situation (i.e., being in the same room with a dog). After determining the patient's anxiety level, the therapist then coaches the patient in breathing exercises and relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety to a normal level. The therapy continues until the imagined situation no longer provokes an anxious response.

This method was use in the above-mentioned study done by Drs. Hoffmann and Human whereby twelve female students at the Arcadia campus of Technikon Pretoria College in South Africa were found to possess symptoms of cynophobia.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=31–32}}</ref> These twelve students were provided with systematic desensitization therapy one hour per week for five to seven weeks; after eight months, the students were contacted again to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|pp=32–34}}</ref> Final results indicated the study was fairly successful with 75% of the participants showing significant improvement eight months after the study.<ref>{{harvp|Hoffmann|Human|2003|p=40}}</ref>

However, in his book, ''Virtual Reality Therapy for Anxiety Disorders'', Dr. Wiederhold questions the effectiveness of systematic desensitization as the intensity of the perceived threat is reliant on the patient's imagination and could therefore produce a false response in regards to the patient's level of anxiety.<ref name=""Wiederhold_6""/> His research into recent technological developments has made it possible to integrate [[virtual reality]] into systematic desensitization therapy in order to accurately recreate the threatening situation.<ref name=""Wiederhold_6""/> At the time of publication, there had been no studies done to determine its effectiveness.<ref name=""Wiederhold_6""/>

=== In vivo or exposure therapy ===
In vivo or exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment for cynophobia and involves systematic and prolonged exposure to a dog until the patient is able to experience the situation without an adverse response.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=66}}</ref> This therapy can be conducted over several sessions or, as Dr. Lars-Göran Öst showed in a study done in 1988, can be done in a single multi-hour session.<ref>{{harvp|Öst|1989|p=1}}</ref> This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44.<ref>{{harvp|Öst|1989|p=4}}</ref> Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. Öst combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact with the feared object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia.<ref name=""Öst_3"">{{harvp|Öst|1989|p=3}}</ref> As each patient was gradually exposed to the feared stimulus, she was encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as her anxiety decreased, concluding the session when fear had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated.<ref name=""Öst_3""/> Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction with the feared object on her own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session.<ref name=""Öst_3""/> Dr. Öst's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that ""90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy"".<ref>{{harvp|Öst|1989|p=6}}</ref>

==== Self-help treatment ====
Although most commonly done with the help of a therapist in a professional setting, exposure to dogs is also possible as a [[self-help]] treatment. First, the patient is advised to enlist the help of an assistant who can help set-up the exposure environment, assist in handling the dog during sessions, and demonstrate modeling behaviors.<ref name=""Antony_49"">{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=49}}</ref> This should also be someone whom the patient trusts and who has no fear of dogs.<ref name=""Antony_49""/> Then, the patient compiles a hierarchy of fear provoking situations based on their rating of each situation.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=41–42}}</ref> For example, on a scale from 0 to 100, a patient may feel that looking at photos of dogs may cause a fear response of only 50, however, petting a dog's head may cause of fear response of 100.<ref name=""Antony_49""/> This list of situations looking at dog photos) to most fearful (petting a dog's head) and the assistant helps the patient to identify common elements that contribute to the fear (i.e., size of the dog, color, how it moves, noise, whether or not it is restrained, etc.).<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|pp=44–46}}</ref>  Next, the assistant helps the patient recreate the least fearful situation in a safe, controlled environment, continuing until the patient has had an opportunity to allow the fear to subside thus reinforcing the realization that the fear is unfounded.<ref name=""Antony_49""/> Once a situation has been mastered, the next fearful situation is recreated and the process is repeated until all the situations in the hierarchy have been experienced.<ref name=""Antony_49""/>

Sample videos showing humans and dogs interacting without either exhibiting significant fear are available.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Showing Interaction|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTYad3uyXAg}}</ref>

=== Recovery timeframe and maintenance ===
Whether utilizing systematic desensitization therapy or exposure therapy, several factors will determine how many sessions will be required to completely remove the phobia; however, some studies (such as a follow-up study done by Dr. Öst in 1996) have shown that those who overcome their phobia are usually able to maintain the improvement over the long-term.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=5}}</ref> As avoidance contributes to the perpetuation of the phobia, constant, yet safe, real world interaction is recommended during and after therapy in order to reinforce positive exposure to the animal.<ref>{{harvp|Antony|McCabe|2005|p=73}}</ref>

10579085,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_the_Farting_Dog,"'''''Walter the Farting  Dog''''' is the title character of a series of children's books written by [[William Kotzwinkle]] and Glenn Murray, and illustrated by Audrey Colman.  The first book was published in 2001. By 2011, the first book had reported sales of more than 1.4 million hardcover copies, and the series had grown to five titles.<ref name=""SLJ"">{{cite magazine |first=Rocco |last=Staino |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/891830-312/walter_the_farting_dog_turns.html.csp |title='Walter the Farting Dog' Turns 10"" |magazine=[[School Library Journal]] |date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

==Publishing history==
Kotzwinkle and Murray conceived the idea for the first book in 1990, inspired by a real-life dog named Walter, whose owner fed him doughnuts and beer and who was prone to foul-smelling [[flatulence]].  With assistance from Kotzwinkle's wife, Elizabeth Gundy, they devised a story about a dog who overcomes two burglars with his smelly farts.  Eleven years passed before they found a willing publisher, [[North Atlantic Books]], and the right illustrator, Audrey Colman.  The book was a success and reached the top of ''[[The New York Times]]'' children's [[The New York Times Best Seller list|best seller list]].  Beginning with the second book, the series has been published by [[Penguin Books]], and Gundy began receiving credit with the third book.<ref>{{cite news |first=Cecelia |last=Goodnow |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Co-author-of-popular-Walter-the-Farting-Dog-1173993.php |title=""Co-author of popular 'Walter the Farting Dog' comes to town"" |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=May 20, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Thomas |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1533556.html |title=The not-so-sweet smell of success 'Walter' authors gas on about flatulent canine with new sequel, and readers can't get enough |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=May 16, 2004 |publisher={{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research|HighBeam]]}} }}</ref>

In 2008, it was reported that plans were under way to develop the series as a movie project for the [[Jonas Brothers]].<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994756?refCatId=13 |title=Jonas Bros. whiff Fox's 'Farting Dog': Disney rockers to make feature starring debut |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=John |last=Scott Lewinski |url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/10/farting-dog-bla/ |title=Farting Dog Blasts Way to Big Screen |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=October 28, 2008}}</ref>  As of summer 2011, the Jonas Brothers were no longer attached, and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was in discussions to direct the film for producers [[Mary Parent]] and the [[Farrelly Brothers]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/hop-director-tim-hill-talks-219516 |title='Hop' Director Tim Hill in Talks to Direct 'Walter the Farting Dog'"" |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==
The books have been criticized by some as an example of ""poop fiction"" for children (in the same vein as titles such as ''[[Captain Underpants]]'' and ''[[Zombie Bums from Uranus]]''); they have been subjected to occasional complaints and attempts to have the books withdrawn from libraries, and some librarians and bookstores have refused to carry the series.  On the other hand, librarians (and others) have credited the books with effectively attracting young readers who might otherwise be hard to reach.<ref name=""SLJ""/><ref>{{cite news |first=Martha |last=Irvine |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93989616.html |title=Farts, Underpants and runaway butts: authors say 'poop fiction' gets kids reading |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=April 30, 2004 |publisher={{subscription required|via=HighBeam}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Cindy |last=Stauffer |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9212618.html |title=Poop fiction; Children's books that wallow in bathroom humor are all the rage.

The ''[[New Statesman]]'''s [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]], comparing ''Walter'' to the 1956 children's classic ''[[Harry the Dirty Dog]]'', commented that Walter ""is to Harry as [[Portnoy's Complaint|Portnoy]] was to sexually uptight [[Holden Caulfield]] - dirtier"".

'''Human–canine bonding''' is the mutually beneficial and dynamic relationship between [[human]]s and [[dog]]s that is studied by [[psychologists]], [[anthropologists]], and [[ethologists]].<ref name=""Coren2005"">{{cite book|author=Stanley Coren|title=The intelligence of dogs: a guide to the thoughts, emotions, and inner lives or our canine companions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nBzuXFdFECEC|accessdate=27 May 2011|year=2006|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-8087-7}}</ref>

Dogs are domesticated descendants of [[wolves]] and have a significant impact and role in human lives. In the United States, over 62% of people have a [[pet|household pet]] and 37% of those pets are dogs.<ref name=Nitkin>Nitkin, Patricia. ""The Human-Animal Bond"", B.C. Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia. Retrieved on 2011-06-19.</ref> In the United Kingdom for 2016 the overall amount of people with pets is 47% with 24% having dogs. <ref name=""PetPop2016"">Pet Food Manufacturers Association. (2016).

[Accessed: 3/12/2016].</ref> At times this relationship can be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] since both species benefit from the relationship.

The related topic of [[anthropomorphism]] deals with the ideas people have about what animals know. [[Anthrozoology]] is a new field of study addressing human-animal interactions.

==History==
[[File:Labradoronjetski.PNG|thumb||upright|A Labrador Retriever with his owner on a [[jetski]]]]

The concept of the animal bonding was articulated as early as the late 1930s, when [[Konrad Lorenz]] and his friend and colleague [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] worked with geese in order to study the instinctive behaviors of animals, leading them to rediscover the principle of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]. The same concept was recognised in Boris Levinson's books ''Pet-Oriented Child Psychotherapy'' (1969) and ''Pets and Human Development'' (1979), which had an immense influence on the establishment of the field of study. Levinson is known for accidentally discovering the benefits of assisted pet therapy. He found that withdrawn and uncommunicative children would interact positively whenever he brought his dog, Jingles, to their therapy sessions. His discovery was further reinforced by Sam and Elizabeth Corson at [[Ohio State University]], who were among the first to research and evaluate pet-facilitated therapy.<ref name=Catanzaro>Catanzaro, T. E. (2003). Section introduction: Human-animal bond and primary prevention. American Behavioral Scientists, 47, 29-30. doi: 10.1177/0002764203255209</ref>

Only in the early 1980s was the term 'human–animal bond' officially coined by Leo K. Bustad, who delivered a summary lecture on the Human-Pet Relationship on October 28, 1983, at the International Symposium in Vienna.  This symposium was held in honour of Konrad Lorenz, and during his lecture, Bustad praised him for his work on the human–animal bond and encouraged others to build on Lorenz's work on the subject.<ref name= Hindes>Hindes, L. M. (2003). Historical perspectives on the human-animal bond. American Behavioral Scientists, 47(1), 7-15. doi: 10.1177/0002764203255206</ref> Lorenz later adopted it in his research on imprinting in geese.<ref name=Nitkin/>

Bustad and other pet therapy advocate formed the Delta Society, which was built on the earlier work of Levinson and Croson.<ref name=Catanzaro/> In the 1970s and 1980s, national and international conferences led to greater recognition of the human–animal bond. Since then, there has been widespread media coverage of animal-assisted activity and therapy programs and service dog training.<ref name= Hindes/>

==Theories==
[[File:USMC-100504-M-3079S-004.jpg|thumb|left|A combat tracker dog handler with his dog]]
There are 2 major theories concerning the human–canine bond, known as the biophilia hypothesis, the social support theory, and the self-object theory.

According to the social support theory, animals are a source of social support and companionship, which are necessary for well-being.<ref name=Nitkin/><ref>Beck, Alan M. (2003) ""Future Directions in Human-Animal Bond Research,"" ''American Behavioural Scientist'', Vol. 47, No. 1, pp. 79-93.</ref> Support is seen for the social support theory in the influence of a pet on an empty-nester family. In this view, the animal is part of our community and is an important determinant for psychological well-being.

According to [[self psychology]], an animal can be a ""self-object"" that gives a sense of cohesion, support, or sustenance to a person's sense of self. Self-psychology explains why some animals are so crucial to a person's sense of self and well-being.<ref>Brown, Sue-Ellen (2011) ""Self Psychology and the Human-Animal Bond: An Overview,"" ''The Psychology of the Human-Animal Bond'', part 2, pp. 137-149.</ref>

==Benefits==

[[File:Puppies & Finals-56 (7138669085).jpg|thumb|Puppy with girls]]
According to the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]], the human–canine bond is influenced by emotional, psychological, and physical interactions that are essential to the health and well-being of both people and dogs.

[[Animal-assisted therapy]] (AAT), [[service dogs]], and animal-assisted activities demonstrate this human–canine bond and this interaction with an animal; in most cases a dog helps improve the quality of life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Society |first=Delta |title=Animal Assisted Activities (AAA) |url=http://www.deltasociety.org/Page.aspx?pid=317 |accessdate=30 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328034132/http://www.deltasociety.org/Page.aspx?pid=317 |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df= }}</ref>

The AVMA officially recognizes that the human-animal bond exists, that it has existed for thousands of years, and that it has had a major impact on veterinary medicine.<ref>[http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/human_animal_bond.asp The human-animal bond], American Veterinary Medical Association (n.d.).</ref>

The human–canine bond also pertains to working dogs, such as modern police dogs and search and rescue dogs.

'''Mastiff type''' means a large [[molosser]] dog. The term ""mastiff type"" has been used synonymously with the term ""[[molosser]]"". For example, the [[bulldog breeds]], the [[Great Dane]], the [[mountain dog]]s, the [[pit bulls]] and even smaller dogs such as the [[Boston terrier]], may be considered ""mastiff types"" in this broad sense. The descriptive term, mastiff type, should not be confused with the breed, the Mastiff. All breeds are individual and should be referred to by their breed name to ensure correct identification.

==Genetic history==
Genetic research into the dog [[genome]] has thus far confirmed the common belief that the Mastiffs share a common ancestor and form a coherent branch on the dog [[evolutionary tree]] within the molossers.<ref>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7290/fig_tab/nature08837_F1.html#figure-title</ref> Historians trace the group to the [[Molossus (dog)|Molossus]], a dog bred by the [[Ancient Greek]]s.

==Semantic overlap with other terms==
As to the extent that foreign loanwords from the English word ""dog"" (such as ""[[Dogo (dog type)|Dogo]]"" or ""[[Dogge]]"") may be translated as ""Mastiffs"", molosser breeds such as the [[Dogo Argentino]] and [[Dogo Canario]] may also be considered ""Mastiffs"".  However, these terms may refer not only to breeds called ""Mastiffs"" in English, but also to [[Bulldog breeds|Bulldog]]s and [[pit bulls]].  In addition, historical records of the development of these breeds shows that they have not only Mastiff and other molosser ancestry, but also dogs from several other branches, including [[sighthounds]], [[terrier]]s, and [[scenthound]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''''My Life in Dog Years''''' is a non-fiction book for children written by the American author [[Gary Paulsen]], together with his wife, Ruth Wright Paulsen. It was published first by Delacorte Press in 1997.<ref>Blasingame, James. Gary Paulsen. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33532-7}}</ref>

The book contains a chapter about each different dog in his life. As he goes through each chapter, he delves into the personality of each dog as companions and not just animals.

It begins with Cookie, a dog which rescued him from a fall through the ice while dog sled racing he Cookie was helped by the other sled dogs gary had. This was ironic since the dog was sick before. How would he have saved him? It next considers Snowball, a dog he owned in the Philippines at age 7 (his first) who was killed in a military truck accident. It then discusses Ike, dog that became attached to him during a hunting trip. Ike continues to accompany him for about a year, but then disappears. Paulsen later discovers that Ike's owner had to leave him when he went to the war. When he returned with an injury, Ike returned to him.
 
Dirk, next, is a dog that adopted him during his adolescence, and served as a protector during a difficult period. While working on a farm, he met Rex, a rough collie, whom he considered one of the smartest dogs he ever knew after observing his activities for a day. He later adopted an exceptionally large Great Dane, Caesar (pronounced See-Zer) who was easily excited, but a gentle giant that loved hot dogs.

The author later became a dog sled racer.<ref>Deveraux, Elizabeth. ""Gary Paulsen: A Taste for Adventure and an Obsessive Work Ethic Are This Versatile Writer's Hallmarks."" ''Publishers Weekly'' 241, 13 (March 28, 1994): 70-71.</ref><ref>Buchholz, Rachel. ""My Life's Work: Author."" Boys' Life 85, 12 (December 1995): 28-30.</ref> At one point, he traded one of his best dogs for Quincy, who was later to save his wife from a bear despite being only nine inches tall. The last chapter is about his current dog at the time, Josh. It is clear that Josh is one of the author's favorite dogs, as he has the most to write about him. At the time the book was written, Josh was about 20 years old.  Josh was known as the smartest dog in the world.

A '''puppy''' is a  [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] [[dog]]. Some puppies can weigh {{convert|1|-|3|lb|abbr=on}}, while larger ones can weigh up to {{convert|15|-|23|lb|abbr=on}}. All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the [[Yorkshire Terrier]]. In vernacular English, ''puppy'' refers specifically to dogs, while ''pup'' may often be used for other mammals such as [[Pinniped|seals]], [[giraffes]], [[guinea pigs]], or even [[rats]].

==Development==

Born after an average of 63 days of [[gestation]], puppies emerge in an [[amnion]] that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog.<ref>Whitehead, Sarah; ''Dog: The complete guide'', 1999, page 158</ref> Puppies begin to [[Lactation|nurse]] almost immediately. If the [[Litter (animal)|litter]] exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious [[runt]]s, human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother. As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually [[weaning|weaned]] and begin 
to eat solid food. The mother may regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid food.<ref>Coren, Stanley; ''Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality'', 2006, page 44</ref> The mother dog usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.

At first, puppies spend the large majority of their time sleeping and the rest feeding. They instinctively pile together into a heap, and become distressed if separated from physical contact with their littermates, by even a short distance.<ref>Larkin, Peter; ''The ultimate encyclopedia of dogs, dog breeds & dog care'', 2006, page 53</ref>

Puppies are born with a fully functional sense of smell but can't open their eyes. During their first two weeks, a puppy's senses all develop rapidly.  During this stage the nose is the primary sense organ used by puppies to find their mother's teats, and to locate their littermates, if they become separated by a short distance. Puppies open their [[eye]]s about nine to eleven days following [[birth]]. At first, their [[retinas]] are poorly developed and their vision is poor. Puppies are not able to see as well as adult dogs<!-- not sure about duration for pups: for about three months after birth -->. In addition, puppies' ears remain sealed until about thirteen to seventeen days after birth, after which they respond more actively to sounds. Between two and four weeks old, puppies usually begin to growl, bite, wag their tails, and bark.<ref>White, Linda; ''First Steps with Puppies and Kittens: A Practice-Team Approach to Behavior'', 2009, page 54</ref>

Puppies develop very quickly during their first three months, particularly after their eyes and ears open and they are no longer completely dependent on their mother. Their coordination and strength improve, they [[sparring|spar]] with their littermates, and begin to explore the world outside the nest. They play wrestling, chase, dominance, and tug-of-war games.

==Socialization==
[[File:Puppies Wrestling.jpg||thumb|left|upright|Puppies playing with each other]] [[File:Pupplies loving.jpg|thumb|Puppies socializing]]

Puppies are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with either their mother or littermates. When puppies are socialized with humans, particularly between the ages of eight and twelve weeks, they develop social skills around people. Those that do not receive adequate socialization during this  period may display fearful behavior around humans or other dogs as adults. The optimum period for socialisation is between eight and twelve weeks; professional animal trainers and the [[American Kennel Club]] advise puppies should be introduced to ""100 People by 12 Weeks"" and have encountered a wide and varied selection of people and environments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paddock|first=Arliss|title=The Importance of Puppy Socialization|url=http://classic.akc.org/enewsletter/yourakc/2009/march/puppy.cfm|publisher=[[American Kennel Club]]|accessdate=28 January 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6My3dJiC0|archivedate=28 January 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Docking and declawing==
The practice of [[Docking (dog)|docking]] began primarily as a preventive measure for injury among working dogs. Docking is now primarily performed for purely cosmetic reasons, and some breeds traditionally have their tails cropped anywhere from slightly to almost entirely.<ref>Serpell, James A; ''Companion Animals And Us: Exploring the Relationships Between People And Pets'', 2000, page 307</ref> Many countries now ban cropping and docking for cosmetic purposes, like Australia, parts of Canada, the majority of the European countries (Austria, Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Czech Republic, Turkey, Poland, Slovakia, England, Scotland, Slovenia, Ireland, Norway and Sweden), while others, such as the United States, permit it. As of 2008, the practice is opposed by the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]].<ref name=""AVMA policy: Ear Cropping and Tail Docking of Dogs"">[https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/081215c.aspx AVMA.org], AVMA opposes cosmetic ear cropping, tail docking of dogs - December 15, 2008</ref> Some breeders also prefer to declaw the dogs to prevent future injuries caused by scratching, or in the case of [[dewclaw]]s, ingrown and ripped-off nails. Docking and declawing procedures are usually performed within the first few days after birth, by a [[veterinarian]], or by an experienced breeder.

44444481,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becerrillo,"'''Becerrillo''' or '''Bezerrillo''' (meaning ""Little Bull Calf"") was the name of a [[Attack dog|Castilian attack dog]] during the time of the Spanish [[Conquistador|conquistadors]].

==Early life==
Becirrillo's date and place of birth are unknown although historians speculate he may have been [[birth|whelped]] in either the kennels of [[Diego Columbus]]{{sfnp|Cummins|2003|p=19|ps=none}} or those of [[Juan Ponce de León]].{{sfnp|Derr|2013|p=43|ps=none}} A black eyed, medium sized dog with a red coloured coat,{{sfnp|Slavicek|2009|p=65|ps=none}} it is recorded that he was in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1511 already sporting battle scars.{{sfnp|Cummins|2003|p=19|ps=none}} Historical records indicate he may have been a [[greyhound]] or a cross between a greyhound and a [[mastiff]] although this is unlikely due to his power and strength; historians have also suggested he may have been an [[alaunt]].{{sfnp|Cummins|2003|p=18|ps=none}}

The dog was owned by Ponce de León but when he was busy with his duties as governor of [[Puerto Rico]], Becerrillo was often entrusted to the care of Captain Diego de Salazar, a man known for his ruthless tactics. He would use Becerrillo to attack natives who defied the conquistadors, attempting to terrorize them into accepting the rule of the Spanish invaders. Becerrillo was especially well known due to the sheer number of victims that he mauled and killed.{{sfnp|Coren|2002|p=77|ps=none}} While Ponce de León was on the island [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] in 1509, it was common to use attack dogs to subjugate the Indian natives.

==Legends==

During one specific battle in which the natives launched a surprise attack against the village where the Spanish troops led by Salazar were encamped, Becerrillo alerted the conquistadors by barking until they awoke. Salazar entered the battle with the dog at his side. During the course of the half-hour-long battle, Becerrillo alone killed thirty-three of the native attackers. The reputation of the killer dog spread; he became more feared than the men who he fought alongside.{{sfnp|Coren|2002|p=77|ps=none}} The dog was accomplished at finding and instilling fear in the Indians and able to do the work of fifty soldiers; he was fed the same rations as the men and paid a wage.{{sfnp|Slavicek|2009|p=65|ps=none}}

Another story finds the Spanish conquistadors outside the capitol of Caparra, where a group of Indians had been captured and subdued. While waiting for Ponce de León to arrive from the capitol, the troops amused themselves by harassing the captives. Salazar gave an old Indian woman a folded piece of paper and informed her that it was a letter that was to be carried to the governor- if she refused, she would be fed to the dogs. The frightened woman accepted in the hopes of surviving, but after she turned and began down the road Salazar released Becerrillo and commanded him to take her. As she was charged by the dog, the old woman dropped to her knees and prayed ""Please, my Lord Dog. I am on my way to take this letter to Christians. I beg you, my Lord Dog, please do not hurt me.""{{sfnp|Coren|2002|p=78|ps=none}} According to witnesses, Becerrillo stopped short and regarded the woman intently. He sniffed at the woman and the paper in her hands, before turning away, lifting a leg, and marking her with urine. He stood by as the woman returned unharmed to the Spanish troops. Upon his arrival, Ponce de León was informed of what had occurred. He commanded the troops, ""Free her and send her safely back to her people. Then let us leave this place for now. I will not permit the compassion and forgiveness of a dog to outshine that of a true Christian.""{{sfnp|Coren|2002|p=79|ps=none}}

==Death==

Becerrillo died in 1514; he had been in pursuit of some troops through a river but was wounded by their arrows.{{sfnp|Kistler|2011|p=11|ps=none}} Normally his body was protected from injury by a padded jacket but it is not known if it was worn that day.{{sfnp|Derr|2013|p=44|ps=none}} His handlers were convinced their opponents considered Becerrillo indestructible so buried him in an unmarked grave in the belief the natives would not learn of his death.{{sfnp|Cummins|2003|p=20|ps=none}} Becerrillo had sired a son, Leoncillo (meaning ""Little Lion""), who had the same ferocious temperament and skills as his sire; Ponce de León gave the puppy to [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] who was accompanied by Leoncillo in his battles on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] in 1513.{{sfnp|Slavicek|2009|p=65|ps=none}}

11159584,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiengora,"'''Chiengora''' is a [[yarn]] or [[wool]] spun from [[dog]] hair. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of '''chien''' (the French word for dog) and [[angora wool|an'''gora''']]. It is up to 80% warmer than [[wool]]<ref> Choron, Sandra; Choron, Harry.

Often chiengora is blended with wool during the [[carding]] process. This blend has some give to it, which is preferable when [[knitting]]. It is also often blended with wool in order to create a yarn with less heat insulation.

==History==

Spinning dog hair is not a new art form. Dog hair has been found in yarns dating back from pre-historic Scandinavia, and in textiles from the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Indians of North America. It was the main fiber spun on the Northern American continent before the Spaniards introduced [[sheep]].<ref name=""thesis"">Greer, J. Suzanne. ""Evaluation of Non-Traditional Animal Fibers for Use in Textile Products"". Thesis submitted to the Graduate Faculty of North Carolina State University. (2003)</ref> 

The best hairs for this application are from 'Northern' breeds, such as [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundlands]], [[Chow Chow]]s, [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Norwegian Elkhound]]s, and the like.

In modern times it is rarely used. In general it is only used by hand [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] with pet dogs.

The '''Lychee and Dog Meat Festival''', commonly referred to as '''Yulin Dog Meat Festival''', is an annual celebration held in [[Yulin, Guangxi]], China, during the [[summer solstice]] in which festival goers eat [[dog meat]] and [[lychee]]s. The festival began in 2009 and spans about ten days during which it is estimated that 10,000–15,000 dogs are consumed. The festival has been criticised by animal welfare and [[animal rights]] supporters.<ref name=""RSPCA"">{{cite web|url=https://www.rspca.org.uk/de/utilities/statement/0315_2|publisher=RSPCA|accessdate=February 14, 2017|title=Yulin Dog Meat Festival}}</ref>

==Background==
The tradition of dog meat consumption began over 400 years ago in China. Although there is no medical or physiological evidence to support it, many Chinese practitioners of [[folk medicine]] believe that dog meat would help ward off the heat felt through the summer months. It wasn't until recent years that the festival in Yulin began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-33220235|title=China Yulin dog meat festival under way despite outrage - BBC News|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/06/27/dog-meat-eating-check-your-own-cultural-bias-before-protesting-too-much/|title=Dog meat eating: Check your own cultural bias before protesting too much - HKFP|website=Hong Kong Free Press|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-27}}</ref>

While noting the ""duality"" of dogs as both companions and food items, the editorial urges restraint in handling the issue and calls mutual understanding from both organizers and activists in reaching a respectful compromise.<ref>{{cite news|title=人民日报评""狗肉节之争""：从两件小事看玉林口水仗|url=http://opinion.people.com.cn/n/2014/0623/c1003-25183646.html|accessdate=24 June 2015|work=People's Daily|date=24 June 2014}}</ref>

An editorial published by ''[[Global Times]]'' strongly criticized what the writer believed to be the Western obsession over the treatment of dogs, and cited [[bullfighting]] as an example of animal cruelty to which the West has turned a blind eye. He further categorised the controversy as a part of a Western campaign against China, and dismissed criticism and protests as ""non-noteworthy"".<ref>{{cite news|title=单仁平：玉林狗肉节——中国平静时，西方来劲了|url=http://opinion.huanqiu.com/shanrenping/2015-06/6743094.html|accessdate=25 June 2015|work=Global Times|date=23 June 2015}}</ref>

===International===

In 2016, the [[Philippines]] Department of Agriculture released a plan aimed at eliminating the dog meat trade by 2020, citing animal welfare and rabies concerns.<ref name=""Huffingtonpost.com"">Huffingtonpost.com</ref>

In 2017, [[Taiwan]] amended its animal cruelty laws to make it illegal to eat dog and cat meat, a first in Asia.<ref name=""Huffingtonpost.com""/>

====Media====

Social media platforms, such as [[Instagram]], have helped raise awareness about the dog meat trade going on in Yulin. Pages such as @Unitedagainstdogandcatmeat and @Helpbanyulin have been primary advocates for fighting against the controversial meat trade as well as making others aware of the conditions.<ref>Instagram.com/helpbanyulin</ref>

Campaigns have had a significant impact on spreading awareness of the festival around the globe. Many activist and public figures take to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and have created hashtags such as ""#stopyulinforever"", ""#stopyulin2015"", and ""#stopyulin2016"" to spread the word. Because of the social media campaigns the number of dogs slaughtered have steadily decreased since 2013 from over 10,000 to 1,000.<ref name=""businessinsider.com""/>

====News====
An article in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] said that, ""the festival is more than an animal rights issue. It is a public health concern.""<ref name=TIME/>

In an interview with [[The New York Times]], professor Peter J. Li of the [[University of Houston–Downtown]] said in response a question that included the claim that dog meat promoters accused Chinese activists of introducing a harmful Western ideology into China that opposition to eating dog meat at the festival began with the Chinese themselves, as ""the bond between companion animals and humans is not Western. It's a transcultural phenomenon"".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Shaojie|title=Q. and A.: Peter J.

'''Saint Guinefort''' was a 13th-century French dog that received local veneration as a [[folk saint]] after [[miracles]] were reported at his grave.<ref name=""Fordham"">{{cite journal |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/guinefort.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook |title=Stephen de Bourbon (d. 1262): De Supersticione: On St. Guinefort Etienne de Bourbon |publisher=[[Fordham University]]  |first1=Paul |last1=Halsall |date=September 8, 2000  |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=""Dickey""/>

His story is a variation on the [[The Brahmin and the Mongoose|well-travelled ""faithful hound"" motif]], similar to the Welsh story of the dog [[Gelert]]. Guinefort the [[greyhound]] belonged to a knight who lived in a castle near [[Lyon]]. One day, the knight went hunting, leaving his infant son in the care of Guinefort. When he returned, he found the nursery in chaos – the cot was overturned, the child was nowhere to be seen and Guinefort greeted his master with bloody jaws. Believing Guinefort to have devoured his son, the knight slew the dog. He then heard a child crying; he turned over the cot and found his son lying there, safe and sound, along with the body of a viper. Guinefort had killed the snake and saved the child. On realizing the mistake the family dropped the dog down a well, covered it with stones and planted trees around it, setting up a [[shrine]] for Guinefort. Guinefort became recognised by locals as a saint for the protection of infants. It was alleged by contemporary commentators that locals left their babies at the site to be healed by the dog:

:The local peasants hearing of the dog's noble deed and innocent death, began to visit the place and honor the dog as a martyr in quest of help for their sicknesses and other needs. They were seduced and often cheated by the Devil so that he might in this way lead men into error. Women especially, with sick or poorly children, carried them to the place, and went off a league to another nearby castle where an old woman could teach them a ritual for making offerings and invocations to the demons and lead them to the right spot. When they got there, they offered salt and certain other things, hung the child's little clothes on the bramble bushes around, fixing them on the thorns. They then put the naked baby through the opening between the trunks of two trees, the mother standing on one side and throwing her child nine times to the old woman on the other side, while invoking the demons to adjure the fauns in the wood of ""Rimite"" to take the sick and failing child which they said belonged to them (the fauns) and return to them their own child big, plump, live and healthy. Once this was done, the killer mothers took the baby and placed it naked at the foot of the tree on the straws of a cradle, lit at both ends two candles a thumbsbreadth thick with fire they had brought with them and fastened them on the trunk above. Then, while the candles were consumed, they went far enough away that they could neither hear nor see the child. In this way the burning candles burned up and killed a number of babies, as we have heard from others in the same place.
::[[Stephen de Bourbon]] (d. 1262): ''De Supersticione: On St. Guinefort''.<ref name=""Fordham""/><ref name=""Dickey"">{{cite journal |url=http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/faithful-hound |first1=Colin |last1=Dickey |title=A Faithful Hound |work=[[Lapham's Quarterly]]|date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

The cult of this dog saint persisted for several centuries, until the 1930s, despite the repeated prohibitions of the Catholic Church.<ref name=""Dickey""/>

==In popular culture==
The 1987 French film ''Le Moine et la sorcière'' (in the US known as ''The Sorceress'') depicts the controversy over St. Guinefort as seen through the eyes of Fr. [[Stephen de Bourbon|Etienne de Bourbon]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[inquisitor]] and the author of the above passage. Thomas of Hookton, the main character in [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Grail Quest]]'' trilogy (2000–2003), was a mock believer in Saint Guinefort, praying to the saint and wearing a paw on a piece of leather around his neck.

A '''service dog''' is a type of [[assistance dog]] specifically trained to help people who have [[disability|disabilities]], such as [[visual impairment]], [[hearing impairment]]s, [[mental illness]]es (such as [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD)), [[Epileptic seizure|seizure disorder]], [[mobility impairment]], and [[diabetes]].

Desirable character traits in service animals typically include good temperament or psychological make-up (including biddability and trainability) and good health (including physical structure and stamina). Some service dogs are bred and trained by service dog organizations, while others are bred by breeders, and trained by private trainers or even the individuals with disabilities who will someday become their partners. [[Labrador Retrievers]], [[Golden Retrievers]], [[Dog crossbreed|Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever crossbred dogs]], and [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dogs]] are among the most common dog breeds working as service dogs today in the United States. Although dogs of almost any breed or mix of breeds may be capable of becoming a service dog, very few dogs have the requisite health and temperament qualities. Such a dog may be called a ""service dog"" or an ""assistance dog"", the terminology typically varying by country or region. The term ""seeing eye dog"" is frequently used as a generic label referring to any dog assisting individuals who are blind or with visual impairments.

== History ==
During the First World War, the German army relied heavily on the use of German shepherds as ambulance and messenger dogs. The school helped to train the German Shepherds to serve as guides. Dr. Gerhard, from Germany, opened the world’s first guide dog school in 1916. Over the courses of both world wars, World War II helped lead to a major increase in the number of guide dog schools in the United States. The guide dogs that were used by veterans in the United States are linked to the original training schools set up in Germany to care for World War I veterans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ostermeier|first=Mark|year=2010|title=History of Guide Dogs Use by Veterans|url=|journal=Military Medicine|volume=178|pages=587-593|via=}}</ref>

=== First Schools ===
Hearing dogs for Deaf People, launched in 1982, train dogs to alert their hearing impaired or deaf owners to a number of specific sounds by touching their owner’s foot with a paw, or nudging them with their nose.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Audrestch|first=Hilary|year=2015|title=Recognizing the Value of Assistance Dogs in Society|url=|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=8|pages=469-474|via=}}</ref>
Dogs for the disabled, founded in 1988, were the first charity in the UK to train mobility assistance dogs for physically disabled adults.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Audrestch|first=Hilary|year=2015|title=Recognizing the Value of Assistance Dogs in Society|url=|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=8|pages=469-474|via=}}</ref>

Organizations within Assistance Dogs UK also collaborate to train dogs in multiple assistance roles for individuals with more than one disability began in 2003.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Audrestch|first=Hilary|year=2015|title=Recognizing the Value of Assistance Dogs in Society|url=|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=8|pages=469-474|via=}}</ref>

Mobility assistance dogs are defined as ‘Service dogs’ by Assistance Dogs International in 2013.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Audrestch|first=Hilary|year=2015|title=Recognizing the Value of Assistance Dogs in Society|url=|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=8|pages=469-474|via=}}</ref>

In addition to the typical canine qualities of loyalty, affection, and devotion, they were looking for dogs that were particularly keen, alert, and eager to learn.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ostermeier|first=Mark|year=2010|title=History of Guide Dog Use by Veterans|url=|journal=Military Medicine|volume=178|pages=587-593|via=}}</ref>

== United States ==

===Definition===
[[File:Service dogs mend Wounded Warrior spirit 110923-F-LX971-077.jpg|thumb|right|Service dog with soldier assigned to Wounded Warrior Battalion West]]

In the United States, the applicable law covering places of public accommodation is Title III of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].<ref name=""2010 ADA regulations"">{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleII_2010/titleII_2010_regulations.htm#a35104|title=Part 35 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services}}</ref>

On September 15, 2010, the [[United States Department of Justice]], Civil Rights Division, Disability Rights Section, issued new and updated regulations regarding Service Animals, as summarized in its official [https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm guidance document], which states:

<blockquote>""Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a [[seizure]], reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) during an [[anxiety attack]], or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.""<ref name=""ada.gov"">{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm|title=Revised ADA Requirements: Service Animals|work=ada.gov}} {{PD-notice}}</ref></blockquote>

The revised definition of service animal specifically ''excludes'' animals whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support, and states that, ""beginning on March 15, 2011, only dogs are recognized as service animals under titles II and III of the ADA.""<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm|title=Revised ADA Requirements: Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2017-02-12}}</ref> There may be state laws giving broader protections to individuals with disabilities in places of public access (eg: criminal fines or penalties for injury of a service animal); if a situation arises in which one law gives lesser or greater protections to applicable individuals, the law giving the most protection to those individuals is applicable.  

Common tasks for service animals include flipping light switches for someone who lacks the dexterity to do so, picking up dropped objects a human partner cannot reach due to his or her disability, avoiding obstacles for an individual who is blind or visually impaired, alerting someone who is [[Hearing loss|deaf or hard of hearing]] to the sound of an alarm clock, assisting someone with a [[Mental disorder|psychiatric]] disability by providing specifically-trained forms of deep-pressure therapy or interrupting repetitive behaviors (such as might occur in [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]]), or similar disability-related tasks.<ref name=""Ravn"">{{cite news

|date = July 12, 2011
|author = Ravn, Karen
|newspaper = Los Angeles Times }}</ref>  While any service dog may provide comfort or emotional support to a disabled human partner, in order to meet the federal definition of a service dog, a dog must also be trained to perform tasks or to do work which directly related to the dog's partner's disability.

Service dogs are capable of assisting individuals with autism. The dogs are taught to calm down their owners when they are having an attack or breakdown. They are also there to comfort their owners when they get upset and act as a social support system. It is common for an individual with autism to try and run away from home, when that happens the service dog is capable of alerting the parents, then tracking the individual down. Lastly, the service dog can keep their owners from eloping or running away into traffic or a dangerous situation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Animal-assisted interventions for individuals with autism|last=Pavlides|first=Merope|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2008|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> 

Service dogs do not only help owners with disabilities, but they also help emotionally. There have been experiments that show evidence that service dog owners have an improved social life while owning a service dog. This is very important when discussing children that own service dogs. Improving someone’s social life includes more friendly glances/conversations and more smiles directed their way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Acknowledgments for Children with Disabilities: Effects of Service Dogs.|last=Mader, Bonnie, Lynette A. Hart|first=Bonita Bergen.|publisher=Child Development 60.6|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> 

While the ADA has narrowed the definition of service animals that are required to be permitted in places of public accommodation, other federal laws continue to provide broader definitions in other areas.  For instance, the Department of Transportation's regulations enacting the [[Air Carrier Access Act]] permit ""dogs and other service animals"" to accompany passengers on commercial airlines.<ref>{{cite web|title=14 CFR Part 382 Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel|url=http://airconsumer.dot.gov/rules/382short.pdf| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161224194842/http://airconsumer.dot.gov/rules/382short.pdf | archive-date = 24 December 2016 | work=Department of Transportation|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>  The [[Fair Housing Act]] also requires housing providers to permit service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals) without species restrictions in housing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fair Housing Information Sheet # 6: Right to Emotional Support Animals in 'No Pet' Housing|url=http://www.bazelon.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=mHq8GV0FI4c%3D&tabid|work=Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law|accessdate=October 24, 2013}}</ref>

There is no federal certification of service animals in the United States. This means employees and staff of places of public access are restricted in the questions they may ask an individual who is accompanied by a service dog. If it is not already obvious what service a particular dog is providing his or her human partner:

<blockquote>Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability; and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.<ref name="":0"" /></blockquote>

===Public===
Service dogs are granted legal access under the ADA Act and may accompany their owners everywhere they go. Under Title II, the ADA applies that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by public entities. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huss|first=Rebecca|year=|title=Canines on Campus: Companion Animals at Postsecondary Educational Institutions.|url=|journal=Missouri Law Review|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

Public access rights of owners, handlers, and partners of service dogs vary by country. In the United States, ADA guidance states:

<blockquote>State and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is normally allowed to go. For example, in a hospital it would be inappropriate to exclude a service animal from areas such as patient rooms, clinics, cafeterias, or examination rooms. However, it may be appropriate to exclude a service animal from operating rooms or burn units where the animal’s presence may compromise a sterile environment.""<ref name="":0"" /> </blockquote>

==== Schools ====
Service dogs are accommodated for individuals who have a certain psychical disability. ADA requires schools to permit the use of service dogs, but it doesn’t require the schools to supervise service dogs. Students should be responsible for their own dog if it is disruptive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hill, King, Mrachko|first=David, Seth, Alicia|year=2014|title=Students With Autism, Service Dogs, and Public Schools|url=|journal=Journal of Disability Policy Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In schools, service dogs may help with performing tasks, or trained for individuals with social phobias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Von Bergen|first=C.W.|year=|title=Emotional Support Animals, Service Animals, and Pets on Campus|url=|journal=Administrative Issues Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> 

Under the Fair Housing Act, emotional support dogs are allowed on campus housing if it meets the criteria:
* The individual is disabled
* Trained to perform tasks for the individual
* Have documentation of disability and approved training of service dog

The following aren’t permitted as a service dog on campuses:
* Non-dog animals
* Non Emotional support dogs (some campuses allow)
* Dogs without an identification of service dog

Disabled owners, handlers, and partners of service dogs are protected under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]],<ref name=""ADA regulation, 28 CFR 36"">[http://www.ada.gov/reg3a.html Codes of Federal Regulation implementing the ADA] Retrieved on November 2, 2009.</ref> (ADA) which generally gives them the right to be accompanied by their service animal anywhere the general public is allowed. Additional federal laws protect people with disabilities partnered with service animals, as well as other types of assistance animals, from [[Housing discrimination|discrimination in housing]] (the [[Fair Housing Act|Fair Housing Amendments Act]])<ref name=""FHAA"">[http://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/progdesc/title8.cfm Fair Housing Amendments Act] Retrieved on November 2, 2009.</ref> and on aircraft (the Air Carrier Access Act).<ref name=""ACAA"">[http://airconsumer.dot.gov/rules/382short.pdf Air Carrier Access Act].</ref>

Although the ADA grants individuals with disabilities accompanied by service dogs the right to access almost all places of public accommodation where the general public is permitted.<ref name=""ReferenceA"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers:  Service Animals|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2017-02-12}}</ref> individuals accompanied by [[emotional support animal]]s are not granted the same protections.

Under the ADA, a place of public accommodation may require an individual accompanied by a service dog to remove the service dog from its premises under particular circumstances, one example being if ""a service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it.""<ref name=""ReferenceA""/> Individuals may also be asked to remove their service dogs from, or disallow the presence of a service dog entirely, if the presence of the animal constitutes a fundamental alteration of the business or poses a direct threat. Persons with service dogs are not required to pay any additional fees on account of the service dog, though the owner is responsible for any damages caused by the dog.<ref name=""business brief"">[http://www.ada.gov/svcanimb.htm ADA Business Brief: Service Animals] Retrieved on November 2, 2009.</ref>

Service dogs can be identified by a harness, backpack, or vest, which may sometimes be colored to indicate the type of service dog. The color blue indicates a dog for an individual with a disability.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Companion Animals in Human Health|last=Wilson, Turner|first=C.C,  D.C|publisher=SAGE publications|year=1997|isbn=|location=California|pages=}}</ref>

==== Breeds ====
In a recent study that was done, there was a noticeable amount of successes with mostly 4 breeds of dogs. The four that were mainly graduated and able to become service dogs were Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, German shepherds, and Labrador/Golden Retriever crosses. In the study, they found that the Labrador/golden retriever crosses and the Labrador retrievers were the most successful to train in a shorter period of time. Whereas German shepherds and Golden retrievers were more successful if they were trained for a longer period of time instead of a 4-month period.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ennik, Liinamo, Leighton, and Van Arendonk|first=|year=2006|title=Suitability for Field Service in 4 Breeds of Guide Dogs.""|url=|journal=Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research 1, no. 2|volume=|pages=67-74|via=WSU Libraries}}</ref> 

==== Nutrition ====
In order for the service and working guide dogs to continue to stay healthy and help the person in need, they must maintain a substantial amount of good nutrition and exercise in order to continue to put in the work of being a service dog. This means that dogs such as sprinting dogs would require protein, fat, and good carbohydrate diet to maintain energy for playing and helping others. Dogs such as hunting or patrol dogs (Golden labs & German Shepherds) need higher fat diets because of their endurance that can occur while playing and also walking or working with people in need. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Nutrition for Working and Service Dogs|last=Wakshlag, Shmalberg|first=|publisher=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=719-740}}</ref>

==== Housing ====
The Americans with Disabilities Act also applies to [[Building cooperative|co-op]]s and [[condominium]]s.<ref name=""habitatmagazine"">{{cite web|url=http://www.habitatmag.com/Publication-Content/Board-Operations/2012/2012-November/ADA-and-Co-op-Condo-Commercial-Space#.VSceAZMYNm1|title=ADA and Co-op/Condo Commercial Space – Co-op Boards|author=Steven D.

In New York, the [[New York City Human Rights Law]] administered by the New York City Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) provides further parallel protection with regard to violations in this regard by landlords and management of co-ops and condominiums, despite a building's policy of no-pets at all or no-pets in certain locations.<ref name=""cooperator.com""/> Furthermore, the City of New York states that: <blockquote>""All service dogs in New York City must have a valid dog license issued by the City's [[New York City Department of Health|Department of Health]]. You may also request ... a tag that identifies your dog as a service dog. The tag is optional and businesses open to the public, including restaurants, must allow access to a service dog whether or not the dog is wearing a service tag. You must meet certain requirements to obtain the tag. Businesses may not demand any proof of disability or certification of the animal to allow a person to access the business with their service animal.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/service/2427/service-dogs|title=Service Dogs|work=nyc.gov}}</ref></blockquote>

====Litigation====
In 2009, New York City paid a 65-year-old woman $10,000 to settle a federal lawsuit against it that it had violated the ADA by denying the woman with her service dog access to transportation with the dog.<ref name=""nydailynews1"">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/woman-sues-10m-denied-subway-rides-dog-article-1.420230 |title=Woman sues for 10M for being denied subway rides with dog |publisher=NY Daily News |date=January 4, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref>  Two New York City policemen had given her a ticket for bringing her dog into a subway station.<ref name=""nydailynews1""/>

In 2013, a [[Brooklyn Federal Court]] judge ordered the MTA to pay a 70-year-old Manhattan woman $150,000 to settle a lawsuit over her service animal. The judge ruled that the MTA had violated the ADA when its drivers, motormen, and conductors denied the woman access to transportation with her dog, or improperly demanded to see its papers.<ref name=""nydailynews2"">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/transit-payout-150g-manhattan-rider-service-dog-article-1.1475981 |title=City Transit will payout $150G to Manhattan rider over service dog harassment |publisher=NY Daily News |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |location=New York}}</ref>

In May 2014, federal United States District Court Judge [[Robert N.

A service dog is a dog that performs a task that mitigates a disability of the dog's owner. Since each person experiences a disability differently and therefore has different needs for assistance, each dog is to some extent custom-trained for the individual it will help.

Dogs were first trained to be service dogs during time periods of after war to help soldiers who experienced post traumatic stress disorder or any other disorders veterans had faced. Dogs were also trained to help soldiers in combat. Service dogs received training for two years, and during those two years, between $25,000 and $50,000 was used for just one dog.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Richie, Robinette|first=Elspeth C., Robinette J.|year=2012|title=The Early Years.|url=|journal=U.S. Army Medical Department Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

=== Trainers ===

Service dog puppies may be [[foster care|fostered]] by programs to private families to be reared until they are old enough for advanced training.

Some individuals may elect to train their own service dogs. There are diverse reasons for this decision cited by owner-trainers, including the failure of existing programs to answer unique needs, closed waiting lists of pre-established training organizations, and extensive knowledge of dog training. Owner-training of one's service dog is permitted, and becoming more common, in certain countries, primarily in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in both England and Ireland.

In the U.S., service dog owner-trainers may opt to train breeds not commonly associated with service dog work, a fact which has led to both great success<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.papillonclub.org/gen_papillon_service.php|title=Papillons in Service|last=Davis|first=Debi|date=|website=https://www.papillonclub.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref> and great controversy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/pit-bulls-as-service-animals-denver-quietly-changes-its-policy-5877640|title=Pit Bulls as Service Animals: Denver quietly changes its policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> as the primary federal law addressing service dogs ""does not restrict the type of dog breeds that can be service animals.""<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html#bre|title=Americans with Disabilities Act Questions and Answers: Breed|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Tasks, work, and assistance ==
A service dog can learn many ways in which to assist an individual with a disability. Some service dog provider organizations tailor training of each dog to each potential partner, while others may train all dogs with the same skill set and partner their dogs only with a specific group of individuals whose disabilities may be assisted by those skills. Owner-trainers generally train their own service dogs to perform work or to do tasks which aid directly with their own disabilities.

=== Examples ===

==== Psychiatric service dogs ====
One list of potential tasks a service dog might be trained to perform to assist an individual with a psychiatric disability includes the following:
*bringing medication to alleviate symptoms
*retrieving an emergency phone in crisis situations
*providing balance assistance
*carrying medical supplies or information
*providing tactile stimulation
*turning on lights and searching rooms prior to a partner entering

==== Guide, hearing, and service dogs (non-psychiatric) ====
A number of tasks and work a service dog might do to assist individuals with vision, hearing, mobility, or other disabilities, as compiled and published by Joan Froling, former president of International Association of Assistance Dog Partners (IAADP), a non-profit, cross-disability advocacy group composed of individuals partnered with all types of service dogs, includes:
* indicating changes in elevation
* navigating around obstacles
* locating objects on command
* retrieving dropped items
* alerting to the sound of a doorbell or fire alarm
* carrying items

==Etymology==
The term ""domestic dog"" is generally used for both [[domesticated]] and [[feral]] varieties. The English word ''dog'' comes from [[Middle English]] ''dogge'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:docga|docga]]'', a ""powerful dog breed"".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclocenter.com/Domestic-Pet-134.html |title=Domestic PetDog Classified By Linnaeus In 1758 As Canis Familiaris And Canis Familiarus Domesticus |publisher=www.encyclocentral.com |accessdate=18 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521193821/http://www.encyclocenter.com/Domestic-Pet-134.html |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic ''*dukkōn'', represented in Old English ''finger-docce'' (""finger-muscle"").<ref>{{Cite book| last = Seebold|first = Elmar|title = Kluge.

In 14th-century England, ''[[hound]]'' (from {{lang-ang|hund}}) was the general word for all domestic canines, and ''dog'' referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this ""dog"" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category ""hound"".<ref name=""dog"">{{Cite journal| last = Broz|first = Vlatko|title = Diachronic Investigations of False Friends|journal=Contemporary Linguistics (Suvremena lingvistika)|volume = 66|issue = 2|pages = 199–222|year = 2008|url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=48370&lang=en}}</ref> By the 16th century, ''dog'' had become the general word, and ''hound'' had begun to refer only to types used for hunting.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=René Dirven|author2=Marjolyn Verspoor|title=Cognitive exploration of language and linguistics|year=2004|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-1906-0|pages=215–216|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uZcs6poXkfEC&pg=PA215}}</ref> The word ""hound"" is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European word ''*kwon-'', ""dog"".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018073726/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE259.html| archivedate = 18 October 2006| title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition| accessdate =30 November 2006| publisher=www.bartleby.com}}</ref> This semantic shift may be compared with in German, where the corresponding words ''Dogge'' and ''Hund'' kept their original meanings.

A male canine is referred to as a ""dog"", while a female is called a ""bitch"" (derived from Middle English ''bicche'', from Old English ''bicce'', ultimately from Old Norse ''bikkja''). The father of a [[litter (animal)|litter]] is called the ''sire'', and the mother is called the ''dam''. The process of birth is ""whelping"", from the Old English word ''hwelp''; the modern English word ""whelp"" is an alternative term for puppy.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Gould, Jean |title=All about dog breeding for quality and soundness |publisher=Pelham |location=London, Eng |year=1978 |isbn=0-7207-1064-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> A litter refers to the multiple offspring at one birth which are called [[Puppy|puppies]] or pups from the French ''poupée'', ""doll"", which has mostly replaced the older term ""whelp"".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dog |title=Dog |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}</ref>

==Terminology==
*The term ''dog'' typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.
*An adult female is a ''bitch''. In some countries, especially in North America, ''dog'' is used instead due to the vulgar connotation of ''bitch''.
*An adult male capable of reproduction is a ''stud''.
*An adult female capable of reproduction is a ''brood bitch'', or ''brood mother''.
*Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are ''pups'' or ''puppies''.
*A group of pups from the same [[gestation period]] is a ''litter''.
*The father of a litter is a ''sire''. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.
*The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.
*A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, the taxonomist [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the classification of species. ''[[Canis]]'' is a Latin word meaning dog,<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and on the next page as a separate species he classified the [[wolf]] as ''Canis lupus'' (Linnaeus, 1758).<ref name=linnaeus1758/> In 1926, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) ruled in Opinion 91 that the domestic dog ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) be placed on its official list.<ref name=iczn1926/> In 1957, the ICZN ruled in Opinion 451 that ''Canis dingo'' (Meyer, 1793) was the name to be used for the [[dingo]] and that this be placed on its official list.<ref name=iczn1957/> These are the [[scientific names]] for the dog and dingo that appear on the ''Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology'' of the ICZN.<ref name=iczn2014/>

In 1978, a review to reduce the number species listed under genus ''Canis'' proposed that ""''Canis dingo'' is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. ''Canis familiaris'' is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with ''Canis lupus.''""<ref name=gelder1978/> In 1982, the first edition of [[Mammal Species of the World]] included a note under ''Canis lupus'' with the comment: ""Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, ''familiaris''. ''Canis familiaris'' has page priority over ''Canis lupus'', but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and ''Canis lupus'' has been universally used for this species"".<ref name=honaki1982/> In the same year, an application was made to the ICZN to reclassify the dingo to ''Canis lupus dingo'' because it was proposed that the wolf (''Canis lupus'') was the ancestor of dogs and dingoes, however the application was rejected.<ref name=smith2015/>

In 2003, the ICZN ruled in its [[Opinion 2027]] that the ""name of a wild species...is not invalid by virtue of being predated by the name based on a domestic form."" Additionally, the ICZN placed the taxon ''Canis lupus'' as a [[conserved name]] on the official list under this opinion.<ref name=iczn2003/> In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf ''Canis lupus'' what he proposed to be two subspecies: ""''familiaris'' Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]"" and ""''dingo'' Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]"",{{efn|The addition of [domestic dog] against ''dingo'' and ''familiaris'' is inferred to mean that these two taxons form the ""domestic dog clade"" within ''Canis lupus'', as opposed to its wild ""wolf clade"".}} with the comment ""Includes the domestic dog as a subspecies, with the dingo provisionally separate – artificial variants created by domestication and selective breeding. Although this may stretch the subspecies concept, it retains the correct allocation of synonyms.""<ref name=wozencraft2005/> Although the earliest use of the name ""dingo"" was ''Canis familiaris dingo'' (Blumenbach, 1780),<ref name=blumenbach1780/> Wozencraft attributed it to Meyer from 1793 without comment.<ref name=itis2017/>

This classification by Wozencraft is hotly debated by zoologists.<ref name=smith2015/> Mathew Crowther, Stephen Jackson and [[Colin Groves]] disagree with Wozencraft and argue that based on ICZN Opinion 2027, the implication is that a domestic animal cannot be a subspecies.<ref name=jackson2015/><ref name=crowther2014/> Crowther, [[Juliet Clutton-Brock]] and others argue that because the dingo differs from wolves by behavior, morphology, and that the dingo and dog do not fall genetically within any extant wolf [[clade]], that the dingo should be considered the distinct taxon ''Canis dingo''.<ref name=clutton2015/><ref name=smith2015/><ref name=crowther2014/> Jackson and Groves regard the dog ''Canis familiaris'' as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the wolf ''Canis lupus'' with them both equally ranked at the species level. They also disagree with Crowther, based on the overlap between dogs and dingoes in their morphology, in their ability to easily hybridize with each other, and that they show the signs of domestication by both having a cranium of smaller capacity than their progenitor, the wolf. Given that ''Canis familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) has date priority over ''Canis dingo'' (Meyer, 1793), they regard the dingo as a  [[Synonym (taxonomy)#zoology|junior taxonomic synonym]] for the dog ''Canis familiaris''.<ref name=jackson2015/> [[Gheorghe Benga]] and others support the dingo as a subspecies of the dog from the earlier ''Canis familiaris dingo'' (Blumenbach, 1780).<ref name=benga2010/><ref name=elledge2006/><ref name=jones1925/> [[Xiaoming Wang]] and [[Richard H. Tedford]] proposed that the dog should be classified as ''Canis lupus familiaris'' under the [[Biological Species Concept]] and ''Canis familiaris'' under the [[Evolutionary developmental biology|Evolutionary Species Concept]].<ref name=wang2008/>

==Origin==
{{Main article|Origin of the domestic dog}}

<!--Note: What is reflected in this section must be in accord with what is on the ""Origin of the domestic dog"" page and the ""Gray wolf"" page (sub-heading ""Evolution and relationship with the dog""). Unless you have some subject knowledge on the topic, please don't tinker – if you are dog-kind then take your concerns to the ""Origin of the domestic dog"" Talk page, or wolf-kind take it to the ""Gray wolf"" Talk page&nbsp;– all of your queries will be eventually answered.-->
The origin of the domestic dog is not clear. The domestic dog is a member of genus ''[[Canis]]'' (canines) that forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]],<ref name=lindblad2005/> and is the most widely abundant [[carnivore]].<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vila1999/> The closest living relative of the dog is the [[gray wolf]] and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=vonholdt2010/><ref name=vila1997/> The dog and the [[wikt:extant|extant]] gray wolf form two sister [[clades]],<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago,<ref name=giemsch2015/> with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago.<ref name=germonpre2009/>  These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human [[hunter-gatherers]] and not [[agriculturists]].<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/> The dog was the first domesticated species.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=perri2016/>

Where the [[genetic divergence]] of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=thalmann2013/> Central Asia,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=shannon2015/> and East Asia.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=wang2015/> This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=frantz2016/><ref name=grimm2016/>

===Anatomy===
{{main article|Dog anatomy}}

Domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<ref name=""ADW""/> Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.<ref name=""ADW""/> Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.

====Size and weight====
Dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a [[Yorkshire Terrier]], that stood only {{convert|6.3|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, {{convert|9.5|cm|abbr=on}} in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only {{convert|113|g}}. The largest known dog was an [[English Mastiff]] which weighed {{convert|155.6|kg|abbr=on}} and was {{convert|250|cm|abbr=on}} from the snout to the tail.<ref name=""zorba"">{{cite web|url=http://worldslargestdog1.com/zorba2/|title=World's Largest Dog|accessdate=7 January 2008}}</ref> The tallest dog is a [[Great Dane]] that stands {{convert|106.7|cm|abbr=on}} at the shoulder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711133443/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/natural_world/fantastic_pets/tallest_dog_living.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |title=Guinness World Records – Tallest Dog Living |accessdate=7 January 2009 |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=31 August 2004}}</ref>

====Senses====
The dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep21848|pmid=26898837|pmc=4761878|title=Cryptochrome 1 in Retinal Cone Photoreceptors Suggests a Novel Functional Role in Mammals|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=21848|year=2016|last1=Nießner|first1=Christine|last2=Denzau|first2=Susanne|last3=Malkemper|first3=Erich Pascal|last4=Gross|first4=Julia Christina|last5=Burda|first5=Hynek|last6=Winklhofer|first6=Michael|last7=Peichl|first7=Leo}}</ref><ref>[http://brain.mpg.de/news-events/news/news/archive/2016/february/article/magnetoreception-molecule-found-in-the-eyes-of-dogs-and-primates.html?tx_ttnews%5Bday%5D=22&cHash=e29a96d380bf79d438733a01ec7bac82 Magnetoreception molecule found in the eyes of dogs and primates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223085252/http://brain.mpg.de/news-events/news/news/archive/2016/february/article/magnetoreception-molecule-found-in-the-eyes-of-dogs-and-primates.html?tx_ttnews%5Bday%5D=22&cHash=e29a96d380bf79d438733a01ec7bac82 |date=23 December 2016 }} MPI Brain Research, 22 February 2016</ref>

====Coat====
{{Main article|Coat (dog)}}
[[File:Dog coat variation.png|thumb|Montage showing the coat variation of the dog.]]
The [[pelage|coats]] of domestic dogs are of two varieties: ""double"" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse [[guard hair]] and a soft [[down hair]], or ""single"", with the topcoat only.

Domestic dogs often display the remnants of [[countershading]], a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below,<ref name=""About.com"">{{cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/zoology12/f/countershading.htm|title=What is Counter Shading?|last= Klappenbach|first=Laura|year=2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> which reduces its general visibility.

====Tail====
{{See also|Docking (dog)|label 1=Docking}}
There are many different shapes for [[dog tail]]s: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally [[docking (dog)|docked]] to avoid injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/case4dock.htm|title=The Case for Tail Docking|publisher=Council of Docked Breeds|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> In some breeds, such as the [[Braque du Bourbonnais]], puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/tail-genetics.htm |title=Bourbonnais pointer or 'short tail pointer' |publisher=Braquedubourbonnais.info |accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>

===Health===
{{Main article|Dog health}}
There are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including [[begonia]], [[Poinsettia]] and [[aloe vera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunset.com/garden/flowers-plants/plants-poisonous-to-dogs-00418000068562/|title=Plants poisonous to dogs – Sunset|work=Sunset}}</ref>

Some breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as [[Elbow dysplasia|elbow]] and [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], [[blindness]], [[deafness]], [[pulmonary valve stenosis|pulmonic stenosis]], [[cleft lip and palate|cleft palate]], and [[luxating patella|trick knees]]. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are [[pyometra]], affecting [[neutering|unspayed]] females of all types and ages, and [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, and [[mite]]s, as well as [[hookworms]], [[tapeworms]], [[roundworms]], and [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworms]].

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including [[chocolate|chocolate solids]] ([[theobromine poisoning]]), onion and [[garlic]] ([[thiosulphate]], [[sulfoxide]] or [[disulfide]] poisoning),<ref>Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item.</ref> [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s, [[macadamia nut]]s, [[xylitol]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = L.

{{Further|Aging in dogs}}

===Reproduction===
{{Main article|Canine reproduction}}
[[File:Säugende Hündin.JPG|thumb|Dog nursing newborn puppies]]
In domestic dogs, [[puberty|sexual maturity]] begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females,<ref name=""ADW""/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref> although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first [[estrous cycle]]. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for [[pregnancy]]. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to [[Canine tying|copulation]].<ref name=""ADW""/> Because the [[ovum|ova]] survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.<ref name=""ADW""/>

Fertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days the heart beat is detectable.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11787146 |year=2001 |last1=Concannon |first1=P |last2=Tsutsui |first2=T |last3=Shille |first3=V |title=Embryo development, hormonal requirements and maternal responses during canine pregnancy |volume=57 |pages=169–79 |journal=Journal of reproduction and fertility.

In general, [[toy dog]]s produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.

Some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male [[French Bulldog]]s, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be [[artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] in order to reproduce.<ref name=""French"">{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070030/http://www.frenchbulldog.org/2008/05/01/is-a-french-bulldog-the-right-breed-for-you/|archivedate=26 July 2011|title=French Bulldog Pet Care Guide|accessdate=7 January 2008}}</ref>

====Neutering====
[[File:Wilde huendin am stillen.jpg|right|thumb|A feral dog from [[Sri Lanka]] nursing her four puppies]]
[[Neutering]] refers to the [[Neutering|sterilization]] of animals, usually by [[Castration|removal of the male's testicle]]s or the female's [[ovary|ovaries]] and [[uterus]], in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce [[sex drive]]. Because of the [[overpopulation in companion animals|overpopulation of dogs]] in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/spayneuter/ | title=Top 10 reasons to spay/neuter your pet | publisher=American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals | accessdate =16 May 2007}}</ref>

According to the [[Humane Society of the United States]], 3–4&nbsp;million dogs and cats are [[euthanasia|put down]] each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down.<ref>{{Cite journal | quote = Although the cause of pet overpopulation is multifaceted, the lack of guardians choosing to spay or neuter their animals is a major contributing factor. | last = Mahlow | first = Jane C. | year = 1999 | title = Estimation of the proportions of dogs and cats that are surgically sterilized | journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 215 | pages = 640–643 | pmid= 10476708 | issue = 5}}</ref> Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other [[animal protection organizations]] urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.

==Intelligence, behavior and communication==

===Intelligence===
{{Main article|Dog intelligence}}

Dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with [[Rico (Border Collie)|Rico]] showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have advanced memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, ""Chaser"", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a [[theory of mind]] by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian [[dingo]]s can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = B. | last2 = Litchfield | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = How well do dingoes (Canis dingo) perform on the detour task | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 155–162 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.04.017}}</ref> Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00263-X | pmid=12725735 | volume=13 | issue=9 | title=A simple reason for a big difference: wolves do not look back at humans, but dogs do | date=Apr 2003 | journal=Curr Biol | pages=763–6| author1=Miklósi | first1=A | last2=Kubinyi | first2=E | last3=Topál | first3=J | last4=Gácsi | first4=M | last5=Virányi | first5=Z | last6=Csányi | first6=V }}</ref> Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.<ref name=hare2013/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-dogs-are-more-like-humans-than-wolves-22095590/?no-ist|title=Why Dogs are More Like Humans Than Wolves|author=Amy Crawford|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Dog behavior}}

Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli.<ref name=levitis2009/> As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.<ref name=berns2012/> Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine
relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.<ref name=tomasello2009/>

===Communication===
{{Main article|Dog communication}}

Dog communication is about how dogs ""speak"" to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit.<ref>Coren, Stanley ""How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication"" 2000 Simon & Schuster, New York.</ref>{{rp|xii}} These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture.

===Behavioral differences===
{{see also|Dog behavior#Behavior compared with other canids}}

Unlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref>Serpell J, Duffy D. Dog Breeds and Their Behavior. In: Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer; 2014</ref><ref name=cagan2016/> In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication.

==Roles with humans==
[[File:Gunnar Kaasen with Balto.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gunnar Kaasen]] and [[Balto]], the lead dog on the last relay team of the [[1925 serum run to Nome]].]]
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as [[bite inhibition]], from their wolf ancestors, which would have been [[pack hunter]]s with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.<ref name=""Miklósi"">{{cite book|author=Miklósi, Adám |title=Dog Behaviour, Evolution, and Cognition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KnVEIrVNGhIC|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929585-2|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199295852.001.0001}}</ref>{{rp|pages95-136}}

The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as [[hunting dog|hunting]], [[herding dog|herding]], [[sled dog|pulling loads]], [[guard dog|protection]], [[police dog|assisting police]] and [[Dogs in warfare|military]], [[pet|companionship]], and, more recently, [[service dog|aiding handicapped individuals]]. This influence on human society has given them the nickname ""[[Man's best friend (phrase)|man's best friend]]"" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs [[#As a food source|are also a source of meat]].<ref name=""Wingfield-Hayes""/><ref name=""Vietnam's dog meat tradition""/>

===Early roles===
Wolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.<ref name=""Groves"">{{Cite journal|last = Groves |first= Colin |year= 1999|title= The Advantages and Disadvantages of Being Domesticated | journal=Perspectives in Human Biology|volume = 4| pages = 1–12 | issn = 1038-5762}}</ref> They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.<ref name=Groves/> Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and [[control of fire|controlling fire]] for a range of purposes.<ref name=Groves/>
<blockquote>The dogs of [[Thibet]] are twice the size of those seen in India, with large heads and hairy bodies. They are powerful animals, and are said to be able to kill a tiger. During the day they are kept chained up, and are let loose at night to guard their masters' house.<ref>''Travels in Central Asia by Meer Izzut-oollah in the Years 1812-13''. Translated by Captain Henderson. Calcutta, 1872, p. 15.</ref></blockquote>
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps.<ref name=""Tacon"">{{Cite journal|first1=Paul |last1=Tacon |first2=Colin |last2=Pardoe |year=2002 |title=Dogs make us human |journal=Nature Australia |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=52–61}}</ref> For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps.<ref name=""Tacon""/> Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression ""three dog night"" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.<ref name=""Tacon""/>

Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt.<ref name=""Tacon""/> The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.<ref name=""Ruusila"">{{Cite journal|first1=Vesa |last1=Ruusila |first2=Mauri |last2=Pesonen|year=2004 |title=Interspecific cooperation in human (''Homo sapiens'') hunting: the benefits of a barking dog (''Canis familiaris'') |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=545–9 |url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf41/anzf41-545.pdf}}</ref>

===Sports and shows===
{{See also|Conformation show}}
[[File:Big and little dog.jpg|thumb|Dogs come in a range of sizes.]]
People often enter their dogs in competitions<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/events/conformation/beginners.cfm|title=A Beginner's Guide to Dog Shows|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=30 October 2008}}</ref> such as breed-conformation shows or [[list of dog sports|sports]], including racing, sledding and agility competitions.

In conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.

In Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the ''[[nureongi]]'' (누렁이), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.<ref name=""pettid"">Pettid, Michael J., Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 25. {{ISBN|1-86189-348-5}}</ref>

The most popular Korean dog dish is ''[[bosintang|gaejang-guk]]'' (also called ''bosintang''), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's ''[[Qi|gi]]'', or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with [[scallion]]s and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.<ref name=""pettid""/>

A 2005 paper states ""recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people.

===Medical detection dogs===
Medical detection dogs are capable of detecting diseases by sniffing a person directly or samples of urine or other specimens. Dogs can detect odour in one part per trillion, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) 40 times larger than humans. Dogs may have as many as 300 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million. Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer. The process of training a cancer dog requires six months. A [[Labrador Retriever]] called Daisy has detected 551 cancer patients with an accuracy of 93 percent and received the [[Blue Cross (animal charity)|Blue Cross]] (for pets) Medal for her life-saving skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/telegraphchristmasappeal/11241191/How-my-dog-sniffed-out-breast-cancer-and-saved-my-life.html |title=How my dog sniffed out breast cancer and saved my lifeYYY |author=Terry Gasking |accessdate=22 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2843349/Medal-heroic-dog-sniffed-owner-s-cancer-Daisy-Labrador-helped-disease-551-patients.html |title=Medal for the heroic dog who sniffed out her owner's cancer: Daisy the Labrador has helped find disease in 551 patients |date=21 November 2014}}</ref>

===Art===
{{Main article|Cultural depictions of dogs in Western art}}
{{commons category|Dogs in art}}
Cultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}</ref>

A '''drafting dog''' or '''draft dog''' is a dog bred and used for cart pulling. Dogs bred for this work have strong builds. All drafting dogs have the qualities that are needed, strength and determination. Draft Dogs are in the [[Molosser|Molosser breed group]] which are dogs that are solidly-built, strong dogs some Molossers are medium and others are large. Larger mountain dogs pulled larger carts. While smaller ones pulled smaller carts<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/akc-dog-lovers/breeds-who-enjoy-drafting-just-for-the-haul-of-it/|title=Breeds Who Enjoy Drafting Just for the Haul of it|last=Mansourian|first=Erika|website=www.akc.org|access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref>

== Examples ==
These dogs are some of the working dogs known for drafting work. Like the four [[Swiss mountain dog]]s, they were used for pulling carts. The size of the cart matched the size of the dog.

Examples of dogs used to pull larger carts include:
* [[Greater Swiss Mountain Dog]]
* [[Bernese Mountain Dog]]

Examples of dogs used to pull smaller carts:
* [[Entlebucher Mountain Dog]]
* [[Appenzeller Sennenhund|Appenzeller Mountain Dog]]

== Draft dog appearance ==
Large draft dogs like the [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] and [[Greater Swiss Mountain Dog]] are known for their large size. But all four Swiss Mountain Dogs are known for their coat color tricolor the combination of black white and brown. The smallest  of the four Swiss Mountain Dogs is the Entlebucher Mountain Dog usually weighing between 20 and 30&nbsp;kg (44–66&nbsp;lb). Next up in size is the Appenzeller Mountain Dog weighing between 22 and 32&nbsp;kg (48–70&nbsp;lb). The second largest is the Bernese Mountain Dog the female weight is usually 36–48&nbsp;kg 80–105&nbsp;lbs. while the male weight is usually 39–50&nbsp;kg (85–110&nbsp;lb). The Largest is the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. Female Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are usually between 50 and 60&nbsp;kg (110 and 132&nbsp;lb). Males are usually between 60 and 70&nbsp;kg (132–154&nbsp;lb). The St Bernard's appearance is similar to the [[Moscow Watchdog]]s appearance. The two breeds come in the White & Red Color. While the original St Bernard was short haired today there are no long haired varieties. The long coat was important in improving the warmth of the St Bernard coat by breeding them with the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]].

== Temperament ==
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog,  Bernese Mountain Dog, and Rottweiler have personalities that are closely matched. They were watchdogs so the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and Rottweiler are cautious with strangers yet if socialized with them the dog will like them better. All dog breeds need early socialization and [[Dog training|training]]. All breeds can be gentle and stable if trained and socialized properly. Bernese Mountain Dogs were likely watchdogs. They are not aggressive. The Bernese Mountain Dog tends to be gentle and friendly. The St Bernard is gentle and loves people. However, like all dog breeds, Bernard's need early socialization and training to avoid issues. These dogs are not the best for the novice dog owner.

{{main article|Mexican Hairless Dog}}
The '''Xoloitzcuintle''', or '''Xolo''' for short, is a hairless [[breed]] of [[dog]], found in toy, miniature and standard sizes.The Xolo also comes in a coated variety and all three sizes can be born to a single litter.   It is also known as '''Mexican hairless dog''' in English speaking countries, is one of several breeds of [[hairless dog]] and has been used as a historical source of food for the [[Aztec Empire]].<ref name=""About THE XOLOITZCUINTLE"">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120719044113/http://www.xolorescueusa.org/about.html About THE XOLOITZCUINTLE] (archived from [http://www.xolorescueusa.org/about.html the original] on 2012-07-19), [https://web.archive.org/web/20120714064639/http://www.xolorescueusa.org/ Xolo Rescue USA] (archived from [http://www.xolorescueusa.org/ the original] on 2012-07-14).</ref>

====Ghana====
The [[Tallensi]], the Akyims, the Kokis, and the Yaakuma, one of many cultures of Ghana, consider dog meat a delicacy. While the [[Mamprusi]] generally avoid dog meat, it is eaten in a ""courtship stew"" provided by a king to his royal lineage. Two Tribes in Ghana, [[Frafra people|Frafra]] and [[Dagaaba]] are particularly known to be ""tribal playmates"" and consumption of dog meat is the common bond between the two tribes. Every year around September, games are organised between these two tribes and the Dog Head is the trophy at stake for the winning tribe.<ref name=simoons1994p229>{{Cite book|title=Eat not this flesh: food avoidances from prehistory to the present|last=Simoons|first=Frederick J. |edition=2|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-299-14254-4|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JwGZTQunH00C&pg=PA229 229]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JwGZTQunH00C|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

====Ancient Mexico====
In the time of the [[Aztec Empire]] in what is now central Mexico, [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s were bred, among other purposes,<ref name=""About THE XOLOITZCUINTLE""/> for their meat.

====United States of America====
Reports of families eating dog meat out of choice, rather than necessity, were rare and newsworthy.

====Native North Americans====
The traditional culture surrounding the consumption of dog meat varied from [[tribe]] to tribe among the original inhabitants of North America, with some tribes relishing it as a [[delicacy]], and others (such as the [[Comanche]]) treating it as a forbidden food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nativeradio.com/jworley/column4.cfm |title=The great Chiefs |publisher=Native Radio |date=1911-02-23 |accessdate=2012-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318032701/http://www.nativeradio.com/jworley/column4.cfm |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }} (archived from [http://www.nativeradio.com/jworley/column4.cfm the original] on 2012-03-18)</ref> Native peoples of the [[Great Plains]], such as the [[Sioux]] and [[Cheyenne]], consumed it, but there was a concurrent religious [[taboo]] against the meat of wild canines.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925225102/http://www.westonaprice.org/traditional_diets/native_americans.html Guts and Grease: The Diet of Native Americans] (archived from [http://www.westonaprice.org/traditional_diets/native_americans.html the original] on 2006-09-25)</ref>

===Australia===
In most states and territories it is not an offence to eat cats and dogs. South Australia is the only state which definitively prohibits the consumption of meat derived from a cat or dog, including the killing of a cat or dog for such purpose. However, it is illegal to sell dog meat in any Australian State or Territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is eating cats or dogs legal?|url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-eating-cats-or-dogs-legal_489.html|website=Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref>

===Arctic and Antarctic===
British explorer [[Ernest Shackleton]] and his [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] became trapped, and ultimately killed their sled dogs for food. Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] was known to have eaten sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. By eating some of the sled dogs, he required less human or dog food, thus lightening his load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:
<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim – and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition [[hypervitaminosis A]] because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.<ref name=""Mawson"">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6137/6137-h/6137-h.htm#2HCH0013|title=The Home of the Blizzard|first=Douglas|last=Mawson}}</ref>

====Taiwan====
Dog meat is believed by some in Taiwan to have health benefits, including improving circulation and raising body temperature.<ref name=chinapost /> In 2001, the Taiwanese government imposed a ban on the sale of dog meat, due to both pressure from domestic animal welfare groups and a desire to improve international perceptions, although there were some protests.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1097823.stm|title=Taiwan bans dog meat|date=2 January 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> In 2007, another law was passed, significantly increasing the fines to sellers of dog meat.<ref name=chinapost>{{cite news|title=Taiwan law takes bite out of dog meat sales|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2007/12/17/135250/Taiwan-law.htm|accessdate=1 November 2010|date=17 December 2007}}</ref> However, animal rights campaigners have accused the Taiwanese government of not prosecuting those who continue to slaughter and serve dog meat at restaurants.

====Indonesia====

Indonesia is predominantly [[Muslim]], a faith which considers dog meat, along with [[pork]], to be ""[[haraam]]"" (ritually unclean). Therefore, Muslims do not eat it. However, dog meat is eaten by several of Indonesia's non-Muslim minorities.<ref name=""buzzfeed"">{{Citation| last =  Shepherd | first = Jack | title = All About Indonesian Dog Meat| publisher = [[BuzzFeed]]| url = http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/all-about-indonesian-dog-meat}}</ref>

====Japan====
The consumption of dog meat is not a feature of modern Japanese culture.  There is a belief in Japan that certain dogs have special powers in their religion of [[Shintoism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Dog meat was consumed in Japan until 675 AD, when [[Emperor Tenmu]] decreed a prohibition on its consumption during the 4th through 9th months of the year. Normally a dog accompanied the emperor for [[battle]], so it was believed that eating a dog gave [[emperor]]s bad [[luck]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In Japanese [[shrines]] certain animals are [[worshipped]], such as [[dogs]] as it is believed they will give people a [[good luck charm]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Animals are described as good luck in scrolls and [[Kakemono]] during the [[Kofun period]], [[Asuka period]] and [[Nara period]].<ref>[[Nihon Shoki]] Chapter 29 – [[Kanbun]]: 亦四月朔以後。九月三十日以前。莫置比満沙伎理梁。且莫食牛・馬・犬・猿・鶏之完。以外不在禁例。[http://www.j-texts.com/jodai/shoki29.html] English: Also, from the first day of the first[''sic. it should read fourth''] month until the 30th day of the ninth month, it is prohibited to use hinasakiri or fish traps.

====Korea====
'''''Gaegogi''''' (개고기) literally means ""dog meat"" in Korean. The term itself, however, is often mistaken as the term for [[Korean cuisine|Korean]] [[soup]] made from dog meat, which is actually called ''[[bosintang]]'' (보신탕; 補身湯, ''Body nourishing soup'') (sometimes spelled ""bo-shintang"").

The consumption of dog meat in Korean culture can be traced through history. Dog bones{{Elucidate|is it a butchered bone?|date=August 2010}} were excavated in a [[neolithic]] settlement in Changnyeong, [[Gyeongsangnam-do|South Gyeongsang]] Province. A wall painting in the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|Goguryeo Tombs complex]] in South Hwangghae Province, a [[World Heritage site]] which dates from the 4th century AD, depicts a slaughtered dog in a storehouse. The [[Balhae]] people also enjoyed dog meat, and the modern-day tradition of canine cuisine seems to have come from that era.<ref>[http://www.dbpia.co.kr/view/ar_view.asp?arid=720538 A Study of the favorite Foods of the Balhae People] Yang Ouk-da</ref>

Although their [[Mohe people|Mohe]] ancestors did not respect dogs, the [[Jurchen people]] began to respect dogs around the time of the [[Ming dynasty]] and passed this tradition on to the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]. It was prohibited in Jurchen culture to use dog skin, and forbidden for Jurchens to harm, kill, and eat dogs, as the Jurchens believed the ""utmost evil"" was the usage of dog skin by Koreans.<ref>[http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/cg/lt/rb/601/601PDF/aisin.pdf Aisin Gioro & Jin], p. 18.</ref>

{{Main article|Dog meat consumption in South Korea}}

Dog meat is often consumed during the summer months and is either roasted or prepared in soups or stews. The most popular of these soups is ''[[bosintang|bosintang and gaejang-guk]]'', a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months. This is thought to ensure good health by balancing one's ""[[qi]]"", the believed vital energy of the body. Dog meat is also believed to increase the body temperature, so people sweat more to keep one cool during the summer (the way of dealing the heat) is so called 이열치열,{{transliteration needed|date=October 2016}} 
whereas in China dog meat is consumed in the winter months under the belief that it increases warmth. There has been no scientific evidence to support any purported health benefits from consuming dog meat.

A 19th-century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains the preparation of the dish by boiling dog meat with vegetables such as [[scallion|green onions]] and [[chili powder|chili pepper powder]]. Variations of the dish contain [[chicken (food)|chicken]] and [[bamboo shoot]]s.<ref>Pettid, Michael J., ''Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2008, 84–85.</ref>

The [[Ministry of Food and Drug Safety]] recognizes any edible product other than drugs as food.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kim|2008|p=209}}</ref> South Korean Food Sanitary Law (식품위생법) does not include dog meat as a legal food ingredient. In the capital city of [[Seoul]], the sale of dog meat was outlawed by regulation on February 21, 1984 by classifying dog meat as ""repugnant food"" (혐오식품{{transliteration needed|date=October 2016}}), but the regulation was not rigorously enforced except during the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]]. In 2001, the Mayor of Seoul announced there would be no extra enforcement efforts to control the sale of dog meat during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], which was partially hosted in Seoul. In March 2008, the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] announced its plan to put forward a policy suggestion to the central government to legally classify [[Nureongi|slaughter dog]]s as livestock, reigniting debate on the issue.<ref name=""Kim 2008, p.231"">{{cite journal|title=Dog Meat in Korea: A Socio-Legal Challenge |first=Rakhyun E. |last=Kim |journal=[[Animal Law Review]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=231 |year=2008 |url=http://208.109.169.73/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol14_2_201.pdf#page=31 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704112343/http://208.109.169.73/journals/jo_pdf/lralvol14_2_201.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-04 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dog Meat to Be Subject to Livestock Rules|url= http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/03/24/2008032461015.html|date=Mar 24, 2008 |newspaper=The Chosun Ilbo}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|script-title=ko:국민 절반 '개고기 축산물로 관리해야 한다'|trans_title=Half of citizens [say] 'Dog Meat Should be Controlled as Livestock Product'|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=200803281211152&code=940100|date=Mar 28, 2008|newspaper=The Chosun Ilbo|language=Korean}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.khan.co.kr%2Fkh_news%2Fkhan_art_view.html%3Fartid%3D200803281211152%26code%3D940100&sl=ko&tl=en Translation])</ref>

[[Asocena]] is a dish primarily consisting of dog meat originating from the Philippines.

In the early 1980s, there was an international outcry about dog meat consumption in the Philippines after newspapers published photos of [[Margaret Thatcher]], then British Prime Minister, with a dog carcass hanging beside her on a market stall. The British Government discussed withdrawing foreign aid and other countries, such as Australia, considered similar action. To avoid such action, the Filipino government banned the sale of dog meat, despite dog meat being the third most consumed meat, behind [[pork]] and [[goat]] and ahead of [[beef]]. The ban eventually became totally disregarded, although it was reinstated by [[President Ramos]] in 1998 in the Animal Welfare Act (Republic Act 8485).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chase, A.|year=2002|title=Strange foods|journal=Gastronomica|volume=2|issue=2|pages=94–96|jstor=10.1525/gfc.2002.2.2.94|doi=10.1525/gfc.2002.2.2.94}}</ref>

====Thailand====
{{see also|Street dogs in Bangkok}}

Unlike other countries where dog meat consumption has been shown to have historical precedents, Thailand does not have a mainstream culture of dog eating. However, in recent years, the consumption of dog meat in certain areas of the country, especially in certain northeastern provinces like Sakon Nakhon and Nakhon Phanom, notably Sakon Nakhon province's Tha Rae sub-district, which has been identified as the main center for the country's illegal, albeit lucrative, dog meat trade, has attracted widespread attention from the Thai population and local news media. This has led large groups of Thai citizens to become increasingly vocal against the consumption of dog meat and the selling of dogs that are transported through Laos to neighbouring Mekong countries, including Vietnam and China. According to news reports, a considerable number of these dogs continue to be stolen from people's homes by illegal carriers. This was also the case following the 2011 Thailand Floods. Dubbed the country's ""Trade of Shame"",{{whose quote}} Thai citizens have now formed several informal animal welfare and rescue groups, particularly online, in an attempt to stop this illegal trade, with the collective attitude being that ""Dogs are not food"".{{whose quote}} Established not-for-profit animal charity organizations like the [[Soi Dog Foundation]] have also been active in raising awareness and working in conjunction with local Thai authorities to rehabilitate and relocate dogs rescued from trucks attempting to transport live dogs across the border to nearby countries. Significantly, this issue has strengthened the nation's animal rights movement, which continues to call on the Thai government to adopt a stricter and more comprehensive animal rights law to prevent the maltreatment of pets and cruelty against all animals.<ref>{{cite web|title='Vietnam Demand for Dog Meat Keeps Thai Dog Trade Alive'|url=http://veryvietnam.com/2011-09-04/vietnam-demand-for-dog-meat-keeping-thai-dog-trade-alive/|publisher=Very Vietnam|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Thai authorities seize 800 dogs destined for Indochina meat trade' |url=http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2012/01/12/thai-authorities-seize-800-dogs-destined-for-indochina-meat-trade/ |publisher=Pattaya Daily News |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115062738/http://www.pattayadailynews.com:80/en/2012/01/12/thai-authorities-seize-800-dogs-destined-for-indochina-meat-trade/ |archivedate=15 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Business booming for the dog smugglers of the Mekong' |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-01-24/asia/world_asia_thailand-dogs_1_dog-meat-wire-cages-mekong-river?_s=PM:ASIA |publisher=CNN |accessdate=24 January 2012 |date=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125130944/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-01-24/asia/world_asia_thailand-dogs_1_dog-meat-wire-cages-mekong-river?_s=PM:ASIA |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='The rise of the dog snatchers'|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/254875/the-rise-of-the-dog-snatchers|publisher=The Bangkok Post|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='You Can Help Stop the Slaughter...'|url=http://www.soidog.org/en/you-can-help-stop-the-dog-meat-trade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121233423/http://www.soidog.org/en/you-can-help-stop-the-dog-meat-trade/|archivedate=2013-01-21|publisher=The Soi Dog Foundation|accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>

However, there are indications that the desire to eat dog meat in Vietnam is waning.<ref name=""China2"" />  Part of the decline is thought to be due to an increased number of Vietnamese people keeping dogs as pets, as their incomes have risen in the past few decades.

====Poland====
While dog meat is not eaten, in some rural areas of Poland, especially [[Lesser Poland]], dog [[fat]] can be made into [[lard]], which by tradition is believed to have medicinal properties – being good for the lungs, for instance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Since the 16th century, fat from various animals, including dogs, was used as part of [[folk medicine]], and since the 18th century dog fat has had a reputation as being beneficial for the lungs. It is worth noting that the consumption of such meat is considered taboo in Polish culture, and making lard out of dogs' fat is illegal.<ref name=""telegraph.co.uk"">{{cite news|last=Day |first=Matthew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/5985367/Polish-couple-accused-of-making-dog-meat-delicacy.html |title=Polish couple accused of making dog meat delicacy|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London}}</ref> In 2009, a scandal erupted when a farm near [[Częstochowa]] was discovered rearing dogs to be rendered down into lard.<ref name=""telegraph.co.uk""/> According to Grazyna Zawada, from ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', there were farms in Czestochowa, Klobuck, and in the Radom area, and in the decade from 2000 to 2010 six people producing dog lard were found guilty of breaching animal welfare laws (killing dogs and animal cruelty) and sentenced to jail.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/271382,1,chce-sie-wyc.read|title = Chce się wyć|last = Dorota Szumińska|first = |date = |work = |access-date = |via = }}</ref> As of 2014 there have been new cases prosecuted.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1019401,title,Psi-smalec-Przerazliwy-skowyt-zarzynanych-psow,wid,16610308,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=116245|title = Psi smalec.

====Switzerland====
In 2012, the Swiss newspaper ''[[Tages-Anzeiger]]'' reported that dogs, as well as cats, are eaten regularly by a few farmers in rural areas.<ref name=""thelocal.ch"">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20121227/dogs-still-eaten-in-switzerland|title=Dogs and cats 'still eaten in Switzerland'|work=thelocal.ch}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/forget-chocolate-or-cheese-cat-and-dog-meat-is-swiss-delicacy-1-2714488|title=Forget chocolate or cheese: Cat and dog meat is Swiss delicacy|work=scotsman.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/schweiz/standard/Schweizer-sollen-keine-Hunde-und-Katzen-mehr-essen/story/19945914|title=Schweizer sollen keine Hunde und Katzen mehr essen|publisher=[[Tages Anzeiger]]}}</ref> While commercial slaughter and sale of dog meat is illegal, farmers are allowed to slaughter dogs for personal consumption. The favorite type of meat comes from a dog related to the Rottweiler and consumed as ''Mostbröckli'', a form of marinated meat. Animals are slaughtered by butchers and either shot or bludgeoned.

In his 1979 book ''Unmentionable Cuisine'', Calvin Schwabe described a Swiss dog meat recipe ''gedörrtes Hundefleisch'' served as paper-thin slices, as well as smoked dog ham, ''Hundeschinken'', which is prepared by salting and drying raw dog meat.<ref name=""books.google.com"">{{Harvnb|Schwabe|1979|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SiBntk9jGmoC&pg=PA173 173&q=]}}</ref>

It is illegal in Switzerland to commercially produce food made from dog meat, or to produce such food for commercial purposes.<ref>[[Federal Department of Home Affairs (Switzerland)|FDHA]] Ordinance of 23 November 2005 on food of animal origin, [http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/817_022_108/a2.html Art.2].</ref>

== Torture for health or culinary benefits ==

There are some groups who believe that torturing the animal before slaughter makes the meat taste better and/or imparts health benefits into the dish, however there is no evidence to support this claim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal Welfare Institute|url=https://awionline.org/dogmeat}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/annual-dog-meat-festival-in-china-under-new-scrutiny/}}</ref>

[[Image:Hundefutter.jpg|thumb|280px|Three ways to feed dogs: Raw food, wet food and dry food in a bowl.]]

<!--In various countries, the semantics of the words ""food"" and ""meat"" are not entirely clear-cut, and a person from a non-English speaking country may be looking for ""dog meat"" rather than ""dog food"". This is especially the case in some South East Asian countries; hence there is always the possibility for confusion between the two topics.-->
'''Dog food''' refers to food specifically intended for consumption by [[dog]]s. Like all [[carnivore]]s, dogs have sharp, pointed teeth, and have short gastrointestinal tracts better suited for the consumption of meat. In spite of this natural carnivorous design, dogs have still managed to adapt over thousands of years to survive on the meat and non-meat scraps and [[leftovers]] of human existence and thrive on a variety of foods.

In the United States alone, dog owners spent over $8.6 billion on commercially manufactured dog food in 2007.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chow hounds: Why our dogs are getting fatter |last=Ward |first=Ernest |year=2010 |publisher=Health Communications |location= |isbn=978-0-7573-1366-0 |page=13 |url= }}<!--|accessdate=7 January 2011--></ref> Some people make their own dog food, feed their dogs meals made from ingredients purchased in grocery or health food stores or give their dogs a raw food diet.

==History==
[[File:Trockenfutter - Hundefutter (23218256045).jpg|thumb|Dog food in bowl]]
In 37 BCE [[Virgil]] talks about the feeding of dogs in his ''Bucolics'':

{{quote|text=''Nec tibi cura canum fuerit postrema; sed una Veloces Spartae catulos, acremque Molossum, Pasce sero pingui:''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?lr=&cd=3&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1850&dq=whey+%22dog+food%22&q=Sero+pingui&pg=PA62&id=1KAWAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q&f=false Virgil, Bucolica, Georgica, et Aeneis: accedunt clavis metrica, notulae Anglicae, et ... 1829  book III, 404–406], with [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA389&dq=whey%20%22dog%20food%22&lr&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1850&cd=3&id=1KAWAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&output=text the note]</ref>

""Do not let the care of dogs be last; but the swift Spartan hounds, and fierce Mastiff, Feed the whey""}}

Around 70 CE, [[Columella]] wrote his book ''On Agriculture'' in which he addresses the feeding of dogs:

{{quote|text=''Cibaria fere eadem sunt utrique generi praebenda. Nam si tam laxa rura sunt, ut sustineant pecorum greges, omnis sine discrimine hordeacea farina cum sero commode pascit. Sin autem surculo consitus ager sine pascuo est, farreo vel triticeo pane satiandi sunt, admixto tamen liquore coctae fabae, sed tepido, nam fervens rabiem creat.'' <ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/columella/columella.rr7.shtml Columella, On Agriculture, Book 7.]</ref>

""Provisions of victuals are almost the same for both [types of dog]. If the fields are so large as to sustain herds of animals, barley meal mixed with whey is a convenient food. But if it is an orchard without grain, spelt or wheat bread is fed mixed with the liquid from cooked beans, but warm, for boiling creates rabies.""}}

In the ''[[Avesta]]'', written from 224 to 651 CE, Azura Mazda advises:

{{quote|text=Bring ye unto him milk and fat with meat; this is the right food for the dog.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PE1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=columella+sero&source=bl&ots=Hb73VzqsX7&sig=NhsIFYiAtx2id2DJ8N6lZlqzOso&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BA0HVbaFHJHkoAT0lYHIDQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=columella%20sero&f=false The Zend-Avesta: The Vendîdâd, translated by James Darmesteter. 1880.]</ref>}}

In France, the word ''pâtée'' began to appear in the 18th century and referred to a paste originally given to poultry. In 1756, a dictionary indicates it was made of a mixture of bread crumbs and little pieces of meat given to pets.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA192&dq=p%C3%A2t%C3%A9e+chien&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1800&cd=57&id=lQGqLxH9eAYC&num=100&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q=p%C3%A2t%C3%A9e%20chien&f=false ''Nouveau dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciencies: françois, latin et'', edited by Fr Girard ((Viuda de))]</ref>

In 1781, an encyclopedia mentioned an earlier practice of removing the liver, heart, and blood of a downed stag and mixing it with milk, cheese, and bread; and then giving it to dogs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA145&dq=p%C3%A2t%C3%A9e+chien&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1800&cd=4&id=QP06AAAAcAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Denis Diderot, Jean Le Rond d' Alembert, ''Encyclopédie ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences'' ..., Volume 35, Part 1]</ref>

In 1844, the French writer, Nicolas Boyard, warned against even giving tallow graves (the dregs of the [[tallow]] pot) to dogs, though the English favored them (see below), and suggested a meat-flavored soup:

{{quote|text=By a misguided economy dogs are given meat scraps and tallow graves; one must avoid this, because these foods make them heavy and sick; give them twice a day a soup of coarse bread made with water, fat and the bottom of the stew pot; put a half-kilogram of bread at least in each soup.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA552&dq=intitle:%22animaux+domestiques%22+chat&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1800&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1880&num=100&as_brr=1&cd=49#v=onepage&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard,'' Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'élever de soigner les animaux'' 1844, 327]</ref>}}

In England, care to give dogs particular food dates at least from the late eighteenth century, when ''The Sportsman's dictionary'' (1785) described the best diet for a dog's health in its article ""Dog"":

{{quote|text=A dog is of a very hot nature: he should therefore never be without clean water by him, that he may drink when he is thirsty. In regard to their food, carrion is by no means proper for them. It must hurt their sense of smelling, on which the excellence of these dogs greatly depends.
Barley meal, the dross of wheatflour, or both mixed together, with broth or skim'd milk, is very proper food. For change, a small quantity of greaves from which the tallow is pressed by the chandlers, mixed with their flour ; or sheep's feet well baked or boiled, are a very good diet, and when you indulge them with flesh it should always be boiled. In the season of hunting your dogs, it is proper to feed them in the evening before, and give them nothing in the morning you take them out, except a little milk. If you stop for your own refreshment in the day, you should also refresh your dogs with a little milk and bread.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PT158&dq=intitle:dogs&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1790&cd=1&id=x-oDAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q&f=false The Sportsman's Dictionary]</ref>}}

(Greaves, which was often recommended for dogs, is ""the sediment of melted tallow. It is made into cakes for
dogs' food. In Scotland and parts of the US it is called '[[pork rind|cracklings]]'.""<ref>[http://www.hyperdictionary.com/search.aspx?define=greaves ""Greaves"", Webster's 1913 dictionary]</ref>){{dubious-inline|for=If tallow is beef fat then it is unlikely to be called pork rind|date=January 2016}}

In 1833, ''The Complete Farrier'' gave similar but far more extensive advice on feeding dogs:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA429&dq=intitle:dogs&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1890&cd=43&id=xj8AAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q&f=false The complete farrier, and British sportsman, by Richard Lawrence, p. 429]</ref>

{{quote|text=The dog is neither wholly carnivorous nor wholly herbivorous, but of a mixed kind, and can receive nourishment from either flesh or vegetables.

It was not until the mid-1800s that the world saw its first food made specifically for dogs. An American electrician, [[Spratt's|James Spratt]], concocted the first dog treat. Living in London at the time, he witnessed dogs around a shipyard eating scraps of discarded biscuits. Shortly thereafter he introduced his dog food, made up of wheat meals, vegetables and meat. By 1890 production had begun in the United States and became known as ""Spratt’s Patent Limited"".

In later years, [[dog biscuit]] was sometimes treated as synonymous with dog food:
{{quote|text=The first three prize winners at the late coursing meeting at Great Bend were trained on Spratt's Patent Dog Biscuit. This same dog food won no less than three awards, including a gold medal, at the Exposition in Paris which has just closed. It would seem that the decision of the judges is more than backed up by the result in the kennel. Another good dog food is that manufactured by Austin & Graves, of Boston. They, too, seem to be meeting with great success in their line.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA523&dq=%22dog+food%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=b&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1600&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1890&cd=77&id=qAygAAAAMAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1#v=onepage&q=%22dog%20food%22&f=false Outing: sport, adventure, travel, fiction, Volume 15, January 1890, p. 42]</ref>}}

Canned horse meat was introduced in the United States under the [[Ken-L Ration]] brand after World War I as a means to dispose of deceased horses. The 1930s saw the introduction of canned cat food and dry meat-meal dog food by the Gaines Food Co. By the time World War II ended, pet food sales had reached $200 million. In the 1950s Spratt's became part of General Mills. For companies such as Nabisco, Quaker Oats, and General Foods, pet food represented an opportunity to market by-products as a profitable source of income.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.sojos.com/historyofpetfood.html| title = History of Pet Food|publisher=sojos.com|accessdate=2011-09-10}}</ref>

A number of common human foods and household ingestibles are [[poison|toxic]] to dogs, including [[chocolate|chocolate solids]] ([[theobromine poisoning]]), [[onion]] and [[garlic]] ([[thiosulfate]], [[sulfoxide]] or [[disulfide]] poisoning<ref>Sources vary on which of these are considered the most significant toxic item.</ref>), [[grape]]s and [[raisin]]s (cause [[kidney failure]] in dogs), [[milk]] (lactose intolerance, causes diarrhea in dogs), [[nutmeg]] ([[neurotoxic]] to dogs),<ref>[http://www.petinsurance.com/healthzone/pet-articles/pet-health-toxins/Toxic-Food-Guide-for-Pets.aspx], Toxic Food Guide for Pets</ref> [[macadamia nut]]s, as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toxic Foods and Plants for Dogs|url=http://www.entirelypets.com/toxicfoods.html|publisher=entirelypets.com|accessdate=2010-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drs.

==Food allergies in dogs==
Certain ingredients in dog food are known to be a key cause of allergies. A popular belief among pet owners is that wheat and soybeans are a leading cause of dog allergies,<ref>{{cite web|title=Pet Food Ingredient Glossary |url=http://www.petfoodratings.org/ingredient-glossary/ |publisher=petfoodratings.org |accessdate=2013-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509101944/http://www.petfoodratings.org:80/ingredient-glossary/ |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}</ref> however many studies backed by veterinarians have failed to show wheat and soybeans as major sources of allergies, and in fact blame the meat protein for most allergies: beef, chicken, lamb, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/greenliving/dog-food-allergy-myths.html |title=4 Dog Food Allergy Myths &#124; Care2 Healthy Living |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>  A number of ""grain free"" dog foods are available that claim to alleviate such allergies in dogs; however, given the current research that true wheat/grain allergy is rare in dogs, these diets are seen as controversial, gimmicky, or unnecessary by veterinarians.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Jadhon | work=WDBJ-TV |url=http://articles.wdbj7.com/2013-01-18/dog-food_36422259 |title=Is Grain Free Dog Food Any Better? - WDBJ7 |publisher=Articles.wdbj7.com |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>

Diets for those dogs allergic to food are made from limited ingredients or hypoallergenic recipes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best Treats For Dogs With Allergies|url=http://www.petsworld.in/blog/best-treats-for-dogs-with-allergies.html|publisher=petsworld.in|accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}} Limited ingredients make it easier to identify the suspected allergens. In hypoallergenic recipes, manufacturers use those ingredients which are less likely to cause allergies to the dogs such as chicken, lamb, fish, and corn.  Food allergies account for about 10% of all the allergies seen in dogs, being the most common cause after flea bite allergies and atopy (inhalant allergies). Food allergies generally account for 20% of the causes of itching and scratching in dogs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Allergies and Food Intolerance|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2111&aid=143|publisher=peteducation.com|accessdate=2013-04-17}}</ref>

==Grain free/low carbohydrate==
Some dog food products differentiate themselves as grain- or carbohydrate-free to offer the consumer an alternative, claiming carbohydrates in pet foods to be fillers with little or no nutritional value.  Carbohydrates in dog food contribute to approximately 3.5 cals of energy per gram, the same as protein per the modified Atwater method of calculating metabolizable energy.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Business of Pet Food |url=http://www.petfood.aafco.org/caloriecontent.aspx |title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Calorie Content |publisher=Petfood.aafco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>  The grain-free diets have created a trend toward avoiding commercial pet food. However, a recent study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggests that domestic dogs are able to metabolize carbohydrates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/23/science/la-sci-how-dogs-evolved-20130124 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Rosie | last=Mestel | title=Carbs were key in wolves' evolution into dogs | date=2013-01-23}}</ref>

==Contamination issues==

=== Melamine ===
{{Main article|2007 pet food recalls}}
In 2007, following a series of reports of [[renal failure]] in pets, there was a widespread recall of pet foods due to contamination found in ingredients produced in China.  The contaminant was identified as [[melamine]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cianciolo RE, Bischoff K, Ebel JG, Van Winkle TJ, Goldstein RE, Serfilippi LM |title=Clinicopathologic, histologic, and toxicologic findings in 70 cats inadvertently exposed to pet food contaminated with melamine and cyanuric acid |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=233 |issue=5 |pages=729–37 |date=September 2008  |pmid=18764706 |doi=10.2460/javma.233.5.729}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson ME, Lewin-Smith MR, Kalasinsky VF |title=Characterization of melamine-containing and calcium oxalate crystals in three dogs with suspected pet food-induced nephrotoxicosis |journal=Veterinary Pathology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=417–26 |date=May 2008  |pmid=18487505 |doi=10.1354/vp.45-3-417|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dobson RL, Motlagh S, Quijano M |title=Identification and characterization of toxicity of contaminants in pet food leading to an outbreak of renal toxicity in cats and dogs |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=251–62 |date=November 2008  |pmid=18689873 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfn160|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbeiha WK, Agnew D, Maxie G |title=Analysis of a survey database of pet food-induced poisoning in North America |journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=172–184 |date=June 2010  |pmid=20393823 |pmc=3550281 |doi=10.1007/s13181-010-0022-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cocchi M, Vascellari M, Gallina A, Agnoletti F, Angeletti R, Mutinelli F |title=Canine nephrotoxicosis induced by melamine-contaminated pet food in Italy |journal=The Journal of Veterinary Medical Science |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=103–7 |date=January 2010  |pmid=19915330 |url=http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.JSTAGE/jvms/09-0278?lang=en&from=PubMed |doi=10.1292/jvms.09-0278}}</ref> which had been added as an adulterant to simulate a higher protein content.

=== ''Salmonella'' and other concerns===

Recently, the FDA has released a video focusing on another major threat in commercial pet food:  ''Salmonella'' bacterial contamination.  They also cite other major toxins of concern.<ref>{{cite news|title=FDA Video Pet Food Safety|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X0F-XYHHxk|date=February 2014}}</ref>  The video references the case of a specific commercial pet food plant that was also the subject of a March 2014 study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.  It details how at least 53 known human illnesses were linked to commercial pet foods made at that plant in 2012.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Imanishi M, Rotstein DS, Reimschuessel R |title=Outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis infection in humans linked to dry dog food in the United States and Canada, 2012 |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association |volume=244 |issue=5 |pages=545–53 |date=March 2014  |pmid=24548229 |doi=10.2460/javma.244.5.545|display-authors=etal}}</ref>  A class action lawsuit linked to this outbreak was recently settled.<ref name=""April 2014"">{{cite news|title=Diamond Pet Foods Agrees to Class Action Settlement|url=http://legalnewsline.com/issues/class-action/248371-diamond-pet-foods-agrees-to-class-action-settlement}}</ref>

The video also cites the dangers of over supplementation of nutrients in pet food.  A study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in February 2013 suggested a correlation between liver disease and the amount of copper supplementation in AAFCO diets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johnston|first1=Andrea|title=DVM|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=February 1, 2013|volume=242|issue=3|pages=372–380|doi=10.2460/javma.242.3.372|url=http://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/abs/10.2460/javma.242.3.372}}</ref>

In addition ""taurine deficiency"" has been found in dogs<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fascetti|first1=Andrea|title=Taurine deficiency in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=October 2003|volume=223|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.223.1137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fascetti|first1=Andrea|title=Taurine deficiency in dogs with cilated cardiomyopathy|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|date=October 2003|volume=223|issue=8|pages=1137–1141|doi=10.2460/javma.2003.223.1137}}</ref> and cats<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pion|first1=Paul|title=Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with taurine deficiency in the domestic cat: relationship to diet and mycardial taurine content|journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology|date=1992|volume=315|pages=63–73|doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-3436-5_8}}</ref> fed commercial diets intended to be ""complete and balanced"".  Not usually considered an essential nutrient in dogs, taurine is plentiful in most whole meats whether raw or cooked,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spitze|first1=AR|title=Taurine concentrations in animla feed ingredients; cooking influences taurine content|journal=Journal Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|date=2003|volume=87|pages=251–262|url=http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vmb/aal/pdfs/spitze.pdf|accessdate=21 June 2014|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0396.2003.00434.x}}</ref> but is reduced in extruded diets. Cats require more taurine in their diets due to their increased rate of protein metabolism; taurine is usually synthesized in the body from methionine and cysteine, but cats' increased use of these amino acids in normal bodily functions mean that taurine itself must also be provided in the diet.

The above observations could also be explained by the rendered, highly processed source of meat being less rich in taurine and by the fact that some of the taurine is denatured during extrusion.  Cats are obligate carnivores<ref>Debra L. Zoran, C. A. Tony Buffington. (2011) Effects of nutrition choices and lifestyle changes on the well-being of cats, a carnivore that has moved indoors. ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association'' 239:5, 596-606</ref> and their natural diet would consist of high amounts of whole meat - thus what has been termed ""taurine deficiency"" causing dilated cardiomyopathy in cats, is more likely to be a deficiency in the production of commercial feed diets.  Taurine is now artificially supplemented back into the diet after processing in the production of most commercial pet food. A similar dynamic occurred in the first half of the twentieth century with an epidemic of Pellagra<ref>Hegyi, J.; Schwartz, R. A.; Hegyi, V. (2004). ""Pellagra: Dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea"". ''International Journal of Dermatology'' 43 (1): 1–5. doi:10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01959.x. {{PMID|14693013}}</ref> in humans living in the Southern United States. The cause was determined to be a deficiency of the essential vitamin niacin (B<sub>3</sub>), which was being destroyed in the mass processing of corn. Niacin was supplemented back into Southern diets and the disease was eradicated.

=== Mycotoxins ===

In April 2014, [[aflatoxin B1]], a known carcinogenic toxin, melamine, and cyanuric acid were all found in various brands of USA pet food imported into Hong Kong. Since 1993, the FDA has confirmed concerns of toxins in feed grade (animal grade) ingredients, yet to date no comprehensive federal regulation exists on mycotoxin testing in feed grade (animal grade) ingredients used to make pet food.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Price WD, Lovell RA, McChesney DG |title=Naturally occurring toxins in feedstuffs: Center for Veterinary Medicine Perspective |journal=Journal of Animal Science |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=2556–62 |date=September 1993  |pmid=8407668 |url=http://www.journalofanimalscience.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=8407668}}</ref>

In 1997, the journal of Food Additives and Contaminants established that low levels of various mycotoxins could cause health concerns in pets, and was found in feed grade ingredients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scudamore KA, Hetmanski MT, Nawaz S, Naylor J, Rainbird S |title=Determination of mycotoxins in pet foods sold for domestic pets and wild birds using linked-column immunoassay clean-up and HPLC |journal=Food Additives and Contaminants |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=175–86 |year=1997 |pmid=9102350 |doi=10.1080/02652039709374512}}</ref>

A study published in the Journal of Food Protection in 2001 cited concerns regarding fungi (the source of mycotoxins) in commercial pet foods and warned about the ""risk for animal health"".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bueno DJ, Silva JO, Oliver G |title=Mycoflora in commercial pet foods |journal=Journal of Food Protection |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=741–3 |date=May 2001  |pmid=11348013 |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0362-028X&volume=64&issue=5&spage=741&aulast=Bueno}}</ref>

In 2006, a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry confirmed mycotoxins in pet foods around the world and concluded that contamination of mycotoxins in pet foods can lead to chronic effects on the health of pets.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leung MC, Díaz-Llano G, Smith TK |title=Mycotoxins in pet food: a review on worldwide prevalence and preventative strategies |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=54 |issue=26 |pages=9623–35 |date=December 2006  |pmid=17177480 |doi=10.1021/jf062363+}}</ref>

In 2007, the International Journal of Food Microbiology published a study that claimed ""mycotoxin contamination in pet food poses a serious health threat to pets"", and listed them: aflatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins and fusaric acid.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boermans HJ, Leung MC |title=Mycotoxins and the pet food industry: toxicological evidence and risk assessment |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=119 |issue=1-2 |pages=95–102 |date=October 2007  |pmid=17889389 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.07.063}}</ref>

A 2008 study published in the Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition found high levels of mycotoxins in the raw ingredients used for pet food in Brazil.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campos SG, Cavaglieri LR, Fernández Juri MG |title=Mycobiota and aflatoxins in raw materials and pet food in Brazil |journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=377–83 |date=June 2008  |pmid=18477320 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.2008.00809.x|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

A 2010 study in the journal of Mycotoxin Research tested 26 commercial dog foods and found mycotoxins at concerning sub-lethal levels.  It was determined that long-term exposure to low levels of confirmed mycotoxins could pose chronic health risks.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Böhm J, Koinig L, Razzazi-Fazeli E |title=Survey and risk assessment of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, and aflatoxins in commercial dry dog food |journal=Mycotoxin Research |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=147–53 |date=August 2010  |pmid=23605379 |doi=10.1007/s12550-010-0049-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

A 2012 study published in the journal of Toxins found concerning levels of multiple mycotoxins in pet food in Europe, which has some of the strictest guidelines.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Streit E, Schatzmayr G, Tassis P |title=Current situation of mycotoxin contamination and co-occurrence in animal feed--focus on Europe |journal=Toxins |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=788–809 |date=October 2012  |pmid=23162698 |pmc=3496989 |doi=10.3390/toxins4100788|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

For all the above reasons, a current trend away from feed ingredients, and toward USDA certified ingredients fit for human consumption has developed.<ref>{{cite news|last=DELL|first=MARYANNE|title=Worried about tainted jerky treats?

==Commercial dog food==
[[Image:Kibbles How Others See Me.jpg|thumb|250px|A cup of kibbles.]]

Most store-bought dog food is made with feed grade (animal grade) ingredients and comes in either a dry form (also known in the US as ''kibble'') or a wet, canned form. Dry food contains 6–10% moisture by volume, as compared to 60–90% in canned food. Semi-moist foods have a moisture content of 25–35%. Pet owners often prefer dry food for reasons of convenience and price, spending over $8 billion on dry dog food in 2010 – a 50% increase in the amount spent just seven years earlier.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/dogfoodreviews/#finest-hour | title = Dog Food Reviews: Dog Food's Finest Hour | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>

===Wet dog food===
Wet or canned dog food is significantly higher in moisture than dry or semi-moist food.<ref name=""NHB"">Messonnier, S. (2001) ''Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats''. New York: Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-7615-2673-0}}</ref> Canned food is  commercially sterile (cooked during canning); other wet foods may not be sterile. A given wet food will often be higher in protein or fat compared to a similar kibble on a dry matter basis (a measure which ignores moisture); given the canned food's high moisture content, however, a larger amount of canned food must be fed.  Grain gluten and other protein gels may be used in wet dog food to create artificial meaty chunks, which look like real meat.

===Alternative dog food===
In recent years, alternatives to traditional commercial pet food are being sold. Many companies have been successful in targeting niche markets, each with unique characteristics.
Some popular alternative dog food labels are:

*'''Frozen''', also called '''Fresh-Prepared''', comes in raw or cooked (not processed) form, some of which is made with ingredients that are inspected, approved, and certified by the USDA for human consumption, but formulated for pets.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/treats-533350-ingredients-says.html | title=Worried about tainted jerky treats? | work=Orange County Register | date=28 October 2013}}</ref>  Part of this growing trend is the commercialization of home-made dog food for pet owners who want the same quality, but do not have the time or expertise to make it themselves.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Jessica |url=http://www.petfoodindustry.com/Default.aspx?pageid=5306&id=46871&terms=justfoodfordogs |title=Just Food for thought |publisher=Petfoodindustry.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref> The idea is to skip the processing stage traditional dog food goes through. This causes less destruction of its nutritional integrity.
*'''[[Food drying|Dehydrated]]''' or '''freeze-dried''' comes in raw and cooked form. Products are usually air dried or frozen, then dehydrated (freeze-dried) to reduce moisture to the level where bacterial growths are inhibited. The appearance is very similar to dry kibbles. The typical feeding methods include adding warm water before serving. There is some concern of nutrients, such as vitamins, being lost during the dehydration process.
*'''[[freshpet|Fresh]]''' or '''refrigerated''', produced through [[pasteurization]] of fresh ingredients. Products are lightly cooked and then quickly sealed in a vacuum package. Then they are refrigerated until served. This type of dog food is extremely vulnerable to spoiling if not kept at a cool temperature and has a shelf life of 2–4 months, unopened.
*'''Homemade''' Diet often comes in a bucket or Tupperware-like package. In the past this was thought to be a diet that owners create themselves. These diets generally consist of some form of cooked meat or raw meat, ground bone, pureed vegetables, taurine supplements, and other multivitamin supplements. Some pet owners use human vitamin supplements, and others use vitamin supplements specifically engineered for dogs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Jessica |url=http://www.petfoodindustry.com/function.aspx |title=How to: Apply human food trends to petfood |publisher=Petfoodindustry.com |date=2013-09-26 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web
|url=http://specialneedspets.org/animals/recipes/
| title = Making Homemade dog food recipes
}}</ref> Recently, small companies have begun to home-cook dog dishes and then sell them through specialty stores or over the Internet.
*'''Vegetarian''' dog foods are manufactured by several companies. They are usually balanced and contain ingredients such as oatmeal, pea protein, and potatoes instead of meat to supply protein. A dog owner may choose to feed a vegetarian food for ethical and/or health reasons, or in cases of extreme food allergies.

===Contents===
Many commercial dog foods are made from materials considered by some authorities and dog owners to be unusable or undesirable.<ref>[http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients Dog Food Project: Ingredients to Avoid]</ref> These may include:

* [[Meat and bone meal]]
* [[Offal]] (wild canines, however, do eat offal as a vital part of their diets)
* [[Animal digest]]
* [[Sugar|Sugar-based sweeteners]]
* [[Animal by-products]]

Less expensive dog foods generally include less meat, and more [[animal by-products]] and grain [[fillers]]. Proponents of a natural diet criticize the use of such ingredients, and point out that regulations allow for packaging that might lead a consumer to believe that they are buying natural food, when, in reality, the food might be composed mostly of ingredients such as those listed above.<ref name=""Wysong1"">[http://www.wysong.net/pet-health-and-nutrition/the-pet-food-ingredient-game.php The Pet Food Ingredient Game]</ref><ref name=""Foods Pets Die For"">[http://www.homevet.com/petcare/foodbook.html An excerpt from the book ""Food Pets Die For""]</ref> More expensive dog foods may be made of ingredients suitable for organic products or free range meats. [[Lamb meal]] is a popular ingredient. Ingredients must be listed by amount in descending order.

According to the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO), animal by-products in pet food may include parts obtained from any animals which have died from sickness or disease provided they are rendered in accordance to law. As well, cow brains and spinal cords, not allowed for human consumption under federal regulation 21CFR589.2000 due to the possibility of transmission of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]], are allowed to be included in pet food intended for non-ruminant animals.<ref>[http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/Public/Q-AND-A-REGARDING-PETFOODREGS.PDF the Association of American Feed Control Officials] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117095239/http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/Public/Q-AND-A-REGARDING-PETFOODREGS.PDF |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> In 2003, the AVMA speculated changes might be made to animal feed regulations to ban materials from ""4-D"" animals – those who enter the food chain as dead, dying, diseased or disabled.<ref>[http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/oct03/031001a.asp Canada Wraps Up BSE Investigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127020446/http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/oct03/031001a.asp |date=November 27, 2008 }}</ref>

[[Image:Chatuchak Weekend Market P1100759.JPG|thumb|right|Dog treats are special types of dog food given as a reward, not as a staple food source.]]
One emerging differentiation between pet food qualities in the United States is the use of standard feed grade (animal grade) ingredients versus the use of [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]-inspected, approved, and certified ingredients fit for human consumption.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trixston|first=Susan|title=Is it Feed or Food?|url=http://truthaboutpetfood.com/is-it-feed-or-food|publisher=Truth About Pet Food}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Chavez|first=Oscar|title=Food not Feed: Are the Ingredients in Pet ""Food"" Safe?|url=http://justfoodfordogs.com/food-not-feed-are-the-ingredients-in-pet-food-safe/|work=Blog Post|publisher=JustFoodForDogs LLC|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}} The USDA certification and approval process is among the best quality control programs in food production in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Safety Around the World|url=http://safefoodinternational.org/local_global.pdf|publisher=Center for Science in the Public Interest|accessdate=2005}}</ref> The [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has recently commented that the ingredients defined as feed in pet food (feed grade or animal grade) are not classified as [[generally recognized as safe]] (GRAS).<ref>{{cite web|title=AFIA seeks comment from member companies on ingredient approvals|url=http://www.petfoodindustry.com/AFIA_seeks_comment_from_member_companies_on_ingredient_approvals.html|publisher=Petfood Industry|accessdate=February 2014}}</ref>  Examples of potential toxins include [[melamine]], ''[[Salmonella]]'', and [[mycotoxin]]s. Only the language ""USDA certified"" or ""USDA approved"" is legally meaningful.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Some companies will say ""Made with ingredients from a USDA facility"", or ""USA Meat"", which is misleading as it can include dead or dying animals or carcasses rejected from the human food chain and is not the same as USDA inspected, approved, or certified, which are FDA approved for human consumption.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bhsah.com/?p=308 | title=Just Food for Dogs Visits BHSAH | publisher=Beverly Hills Small Animal Hospital}}</ref>

===Packaging===
Dry dog food (kibbles) is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer;  similar bag styles  with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.  Wet dog food is often packed in [[aluminum can]]s or [[steel can]]s.  Packaging regulations for dog food are often very similar to corresponding regulations for human foods. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Raw dog food==
{{Main article|Raw feeding}}
Supporters of raw feeding believe that the natural diet of an animal in the wild is its most ideal diet and try to mimic a similar diet for their domestic companion. They are commonly opposed to commercial pet foods, which they consider poor substitutes for raw feed. Opponents believe that the risk of food-borne illnesses posed by the handling and feeding of raw meats would outweigh the purported benefits and that no scientific studies have been done to support the numerous beneficial claims. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] of the United States states that they do not advocate a raw diet but recommends owners who insist on feeding raw to follow basic hygienic guidelines for handling raw meat to minimize risk to animal and human health.<ref>{{cite web
| url = http://www.fda.gov/cvm/foodbornetips.htm
| title = FDA, ""FDA TIPS for Preventing Foodborne Illness Associated with Pet Food and Pet Treats""
| work = [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]}}</ref>

Many commercial raw pet food manufacturers now utilize a process called [[Pascalization|High Pressure Pascalization (HPP)]] that is a unique process that kills pathogenic bacteria through high-pressure, water-based technology. High Pressure Pascalization is a USDA-approved, and is allowed for use on organic and natural products.

Commercial frozen raw dog food is distributed by various independent pet specialty retailers.

In the United States, dog foods labelled as ""complete and balanced"" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. The Dog Food Nutrient Profiles were last updated in 1995 by the AAFCO's Canine Nutrition Expert Subcommittee.

Critics argue that due to the limitations of the trial and the gaps in knowledge within animal nutrition science, the term ""complete and balanced"" is inaccurate and even deceptive.  An AAFCO panel expert has stated that ""although the AAFCO profiles are better than nothing, they provide false securities.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vin.com/VINDBPub/SearchPB/Proceedings/PR05000/PR00001.htm|title=Alternative Feeding Practices|work=World Small Animal Veterinary Association|year=2001|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref>

Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions. There are also varieties of dog food labeled as ""human-grade food"". Although no official definition of this term exists, the assumption is that other brands use foods that would not pass US Food and Drug Administration inspection according to the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] or the [[Meat Inspection Act]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The ingredients on the label must be listed in descending order by weight before cooking.  This means before all of the moisture is removed from the meat, fruits, vegetables and other ingredients used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Recalls==
{{Main article|2007 pet food recalls}}
[[Image:Pet Food Aisle.jpg|thumb|right|Dog food at a supermarket in [[Brooklyn, New York]].]]

The 2007 pet food recalls involved the massive [[Product recall|recall]] of many brands of [[domestic cat|cat]] and [[domestic dog|dog]] foods beginning in March 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/safetyhealth/RecallsWithdrawals/ucm129932.htm | title=FDA Animal Safety Recalls}}</ref>  The recalls came in response to reports of [[renal failure]] in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with [[Gluten|wheat gluten]] from a single [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] company, beginning in February 2007.  After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Menu Foods]] on March 16, 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals.

Overall, several major companies have recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods, with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods.  Although there are several theories of the source of the agent causing sickness in affected animals, with extensive government and private testing and forensic research, to date, no definitive cause has been isolated.  As of April 10, the most likely cause, according to the FDA, though not yet proven, is indicated by the presence of [[melamine]] in wheat gluten in the affected foods.

In the United States, there has been extensive media coverage of the recall.  There has been widespread public outrage and calls for [[government regulation]] of pet foods, which had previously been self-regulated by pet food manufacturers. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods losing roughly $30 Million alone from the recall. The events have caused distrust of most processed pet foods in some consumers.

In 1999, another fungal toxin triggered the recall of dry dog food made by Doane Pet Care at one of its plants, including Ol' Roy, [[Wal-Mart]]'s brand, as well as 53 other brands. This time the toxin killed 25 dogs.<ref>{{cite web

A 2005 consumer alert was released for contaminated Diamond Pet Foods for dogs and cats. Over 100 canine deaths and at least one feline fatality have been linked to Diamond Pet Foods contaminated by the potentially deadly toxin, Aflatoxin, according to Cornell University veterinarians.<ref>{{cite web

In recent years, recalls of traditional and raw commercial pet foods have become frequent due to increased awareness and testing by the FDA.  Every few months a new large scale recall is announced and a dynamic list of recall alerts is being continually updated by the FDA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/safetyhealth/recallswithdrawals/default.htm |title=Recalls & Withdrawals |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>

Dogs played various roles during the time of the Revolutionary War. In addition to formal uses like their role in hunting, dogs often accompanied their owners while they were fighting and provided comfort for their owners and those with them in camps. During this time, dogs were being newly studied in science and depicted in art.

== History ==
By 1775 at the start of the Revolutionary War, dogs were well established and part of the culture of the [[Thirteen Colonies]].<ref name="":0"">{{Cite journal|last=Cubbison|first=Douglas R.|year=|title=The Dogs of War|url=|journal=Patriots of the American Revolution|publication-date=May–June 2011|volume=4|issue=3|page=50|pages=|via=}}</ref> However, they were not always welcome. In 1772, the city leaders of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] passed legislation called the ''Act to Prevent Mischief from Dogs'' that forbade anyone to own a female dog in the city.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal|last=Breig|first=James|title=The Eighteenth Century Goes to the Dogs|url=https://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Autumn04/dogs.cfm|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|publication-date=Autumn 2004}}</ref> Those living in Williamsburg were allowed to keep up to two male dogs, assuming they wore collars with their owners’ initials.<ref name="":1"" /> Dogs outside of these requirements were to be killed. In the eighteenth century, science was improving and expanding to include more research on animals.<ref name="":1"" /> This new attention being paid to animals allowed people to think of dogs (and other animals) as having feelings and personalities like people.<ref name="":1"" /> In 1776, an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman named Humphrey Primatt published ''A Dissertation on the Duty of Mercy and Sin of Cruelty to Brute Animals'', a document often referred to as a Declaration of Independence for animals.<ref name="":1"" /> Following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas about the merit of humanitarianism came an acceptance of humanitarian activities for animals.<ref name="":1"" /> In addition, there was a growing popularity of [[fox hunting]] in both [[England]] and the colonies that created a need for hunting dogs.<ref name="":1"" /> Dogs became more popular as pets ""as scientific classification of species of plants [and] animals was growing."" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://b-womeninamericanhistory18.blogspot.com/2014/03/18c-americans-with-dogs-cats.html|title=18C American Women: 18C American Women & Girls with Dogs & Cats|last=Sarudy|first=Barbara Wells|date=2014-03-12|website=18C American Women|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> Dogs traditionally herded livestock, carried messages, guarded their owners, and carried packs for their owners in addition to retrieving game.<ref name="":1"" /> During the Revolutionary War, they provided also comfort for their owners who were far from home. While fighting, both British and American soldiers adopted stray dogs and other animals as they traveled.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last=Cubbison|first=Douglas R.|year=|title=The Dogs of War|url=|journal=Patriots of the American Revolution|publication-date=May–June 2011|volume=4|issue=3|page=54|pages=|via=}}</ref>

== George Washington's Dogs ==
[[George Washington]], our first President and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Continental Army]], was integral to the Revolutionary War. While at [[Mount Vernon]], Washington inspected the dog kennels twice a day and visited with his hounds.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/dogs/|title=Dogs|last=|first=|date=|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-13}}</ref> He was an avid hunter and maintained kennels of foxhounds for this purpose.<ref name="":11"" /> Though most of his dogs were used for hunting and breeding, he brought along his favorite dog, Sweet Lips, with him when he went to the [[First Continental Congress]] in 1774.<ref name="":0"" /> During the winter months he went foxhunting a couple times a week.<ref name="":3"" /> In addition to admiration for some of the dogs he kept for domestic purposes like Sweet Lips, Venus, and True Love, Washington spent a lot of time writing about his rides with his foxhounds.<ref name="":1"" /> After the War was over, Washington experimented in dog breeding.<ref name="":1"" /> He sought to create a hunting dog that was fast, smart, and had a sharp nose.<ref name="":1"" /> After [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|General Marquis de Lafayette]] sent Washington a few of his favorite French hounds in 1785,<ref name="":4"">{{Cite news|url=|title=First President Started Breed of Foxhounds|last=|first=|date=May 24, 1936|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|via=ProQuest Historical Newspapers}}</ref> Washington began including the French pups in his breeding experiments.<ref name="":1"" /> The [[American Foxhound|American foxhound]], a lighter, faster, smarter, and taller dog than its French or British cousin,<ref name="":1"" /> sprouted from these experiments, resulting in Washington being known as the “father of the American foxhound”.<ref name="":4"" />

=== Returning General Howe's Terrier ===
Like George Washington and many other commanders, General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], a British commander, kept dogs with him while he was in battle.<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal|last=Cubbison|first=Douglas R.|date=May–June 2011|year=|title=The Dogs of War|url=|journal=Patriots of the American Revolution|volume=4|issue=3|page=52|pages=|via=}}</ref> During a surprise attack on the British at [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]] on October 6, 1777, Howe’s fox terrier, Lila, was lost in the commotion and ended up joining the American Army as it withdrew from the battlefield back to its encampment.<ref name="":11"" /> When Howe’s dog found its way into Washington’s headquarters marquee, Washington was alerted that the dog’s collar had Howe’s name engraved. Washington ordered that the terrier be returned to Howe and included a polite note: <blockquote>“General Washington’s compliments to General Howe. He does himself the pleasure to return him a dog, which accidentally fell into his hands, and by the inscription on the Collar appears to belong to General Howe”.<ref>“From George Washington to General William Howe, 6 October 1777,” ''Founders Online,'' National Archives, last modified October 5, 2016, http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-11-02-0432.</ref> </blockquote>

== General Charles Lee's Dogs and more ==

Continental Army Major [[Charles Lee (general)|General Charles Lee]] is remembered not only for his military accomplishments, but also for usually traveling with many dogs by his side. Lee was deeply attached to his dogs, and carried that reputation with him wherever he went.<ref name="":9"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pomeranianproject.com/spado.html|title=The Story of Spado and General Lee|website=www.pomeranianproject.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> He is remembered for his eccentric love of dogs and for his [[Pomeranian (dog)|Pomeranian]], Spado (sometimes referred to as Spada).<ref name="":6"">{{Cite journal|last=Harrington|first=Hugh T.|title=Unleashing the Dogs of War|journal=Journal of the American Revolution|publication-date=March 4, 2013}}</ref> Lee wrote to George Washington on February 9, 1777 expressing how he missed his dogs while in [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="":7"">“To George Washington from Major General Charles Lee, 9 February 1777,” ''Founders Online,'' National Archives, last modified October 5, 2016, http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-08-02-0308.</ref> He said, “I am likewise extremely desirous that My Dogs should be brought as I never stood in greater need of their Company than at present.” <ref name="":7"" /> Spado was permitted to accompany his master while he was traveling for military campaigns.<ref name="":9"" /> While in [[Halifax, Virginia]], Lee is remembered for not allowing Spado ""'to eat bacon for breakfast... lest it make him stupid.'"" <ref name="":9"" />

[[John Adams]] described Lee as a “queer creature” and suggested that “you must love his dogs if you love him”.<ref>“From John Adams to James Warren, 24 July 1775,” ''Founders Online,''National Archives, last modified October 5, 2016, http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/06-03-02-0052.</ref> Adams was an owner of dogs as well.<ref name="":10"">{{Cite news|url=http://www.yavapaihumane.org/dogs-and-american-revolutionary-war/|title=Dogs and the American Revolutionary War*|newspaper=Yavapai Humane Society|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> Abigail's favorite was named Juno, but their more well-remembered dog bore the name of Satan.<ref name="":10"" /> One of Lee’s contemporaries remembered Lee as a “great admirer of dogs”.<ref name="":10"" /> One story of Lee and his dogs involves [[Abigail Adams]]. At a party, Lee ordered his favorite dog and frequent companion, Spado, to climb on a chair and present his paw to Abigail Adams to shake.<ref name="":6"" /> Abigail Adams, in a letter to her husband on December 10, 1775, recalled the event: <blockquote>“General Lee, who was very urgent with me to tarry in Town and dine with him and the Laidies present, at Hob Goblin Hall, but I excused my self. The General was determined that I should not only be acquainted with him, but with his companions too, and therefore placed a chair before me into which he orderd Mr. Sparder to mount and present his paw to me for a better acquaintance. I could not do otherways than accept it.—That Madam says he is the Dog which Mr. . . . . . has renderd famous”.<ref>“Abigail Adams to John Adams, 10 December 1775,” ''Founders Online,''National Archives, last modified October 5, 2016, http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/04-01-02-0221.</ref> </blockquote>

== Baron von Steuben's Dogs ==
[[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a [[Prussia]]n and American military officer, served as inspector general and major general of the Continental Army and played a vital role in leading training and inspection tours for the Continental Army at [[Valley Forge]].<ref name="":2"" /> Steuben is remembered for many unconventionalities, but perhaps most frequently for his love of dogs.<ref name="":8"">{{Cite journal|last=Cubbison|first=Douglas R.|year=|title=The Dogs of War|url=|journal=Patriots of the American Revolution|publication-date=May–June 2011|volume=4|issue=3|page=53|pages=|via=}}</ref> Azor, an Italian greyhound and Steuben’s favorite dog, travelled with the Baron wherever he went throughout the war. Azor’s name and stories of his relationship with the Baron can be found in many accounts of those who interacted with Steuben during his time with the Continental Army.<ref name="":11"">{{Cite news|url=http://www.historyisfun.org/blog/dogs-of-war/|title=Dogs of War - History Is Fun|date=2013-12-10|newspaper=History Is Fun|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> Peter S.

'''Dog bite prevention''' is the effort to [[education | educate]] the public on the prevention of being attacked, [[dog bite | bitten and killed by a dog]] or dogs. Approximately 16,000–39,000 persons come in contact with potentially [[rabies|rabid]] dogs and other animals and receive rabies [[immunizations |pre-]] and postexposure prophylaxis against the rabies virus each year.<ref name = CDC2008> {{cite web | title = Human Rabies Prevention, United States, Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | access-date = April 25, 2017 | date = 2008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr57e507.pdf | page = 2 }}</ref> Up to 800,000 Americans are treated for dog bites each year. About half are children. Young children are typically bitten by familiar or family dogs during normal activities. Some people, like the very young or the very old are more susceptible to being bitten and therefore may need additional methods of prevention.<ref name = CDC2015/><ref name = AMA2017> {{cite web | title = Dog Bite Prevention |publisher = American Veterinary Medical Association  | date = 2017 | access-date = April 25, 2017 | url = https://www.avma.org/public/Pages/Dog-Bite-Prevention.aspx }} </ref>

Approximately 4.5 million dog bites occur each year in the United States. In addition to causing pain, injury, or nerve damage, almost 1 out of 5 bites becomes infected, placing the bite victim at risk for illness or death. Those who work and live around dogs should be aware of the risk and take precautions.<ref name = CDC2015/>

== Identifying risk ==

Identifying the risk of being bitten by a dog can prevent an attack and subsequent injury or death. Infants and children are more likely to be bitten. Small children can be attacked if they approach or play with a dog when they are not supervised. Among children, the rate of dog-bite–related injuries is highest for those 5 to 9 years old. Children are more likely than adults to need medical attention for dog bites. Men are more likely than women to be bitten by a dog. Over half of dog-bite injuries occur at home with dogs that are familiar to us. Among children and adults, having a dog in the household is associated with a higher likelihood of being bitten than not having a dog. As the number of dogs in the home increases, so does the likelihood of being bitten. Adults with two or more dogs in the household are five times more likely to be bitten than those living without dogs at home.<ref name = CDC2015/><ref name = AMA2017/>

The behavior of a dog can not always indicate its friendliness or unlikelihood of biting. This is because when a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing happiness and friendliness. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tall wagging is also an indication of fear, insecurity, challenging of dominance, establishing social relationships or a warning that the dog may bite.<ref name = wagging>{{cite web | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201112/what-wagging-dog-tail-really-means-new-scientific-data | first = Stanley | last = Coren | date = December 5, 2011 | access-date = April 30, 2017 | title =What a Wagging Dog Tail Really Means: New Scientific Data Specific tail wags provide information about the emotional state of dogs | publisher = Psychology Today }} </ref>

== Recommendations ==
Many organizations, non profit, companies, educational entities and governmental agencies publish recommendations for the public in the prevention of dog bites. Some of these are:
* Do not attempt to break up a dog fight.<ref name = shep> {{cite web | url = http://www.shepardhavenlaw.com/stop-a-dog-fight/#tips | title = Tips for Stopping a Dog Fight | access-date = May 5, 2017}}</ref>
* Remain motionless (e.g., ""be still like a tree"") when approached by an unfamiliar dog.
* Curl into a ball with your head tucked and your hands over your ears and neck if a dog knocks you over.
* Immediately let an adult know about stray dogs or dogs that are behaving strangely.
* Do not approach an unfamiliar dog.
* Do not run from a dog.
* Do not panic or make loud noises.
* Do not disturb a dog that is caring for puppies.
* Do not Pet a dog without allowing it to see and sniff you first.
* Do not encourage your dog to play aggressively.
* Do not let small children play with a dog unsupervised.<ref name = CDC2015/>
* Monitor the family pet for illness such as an ear infection when the animal is more prone to bite.
* Avoid waking the dog, call the dog by name.
* Avoid retrieving objects from the dog's mouth.
* Avoid face-to-face interaction with the dog.
* Do  not disturb the dog while the animal is eating.
* Reduce the dog's interaction with children.

If the dog has a history of snapping, growling, or biting, this may indicate that it will behave aggressively.<ref name = AMVA2017> {{cite web | url = http://www.avmamedia.org/display.asp?sid=526&NAME=National_Dog_Bite_Prevention_Week_2013_%28May_19-25%29 | date = 2017 | access-date = April 25, 2017 | title = National Dog Bite Prevention Week 2014 (May 18-24) Podcast | publisher = American Veterinary Medical Association }}</ref>
* Be sensitive to and learn to interpret the body language of dogs<ref name = ahs> {{ cite web | url = http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/avoid_dog_bites.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/ | access-date = April 28, 2017 | publisher = The Human Society of the United States | date = 2017 | title = How to Avoid a Dog Bite -Be polite and pay attention to body language.}} </ref> The dog can alter its body position so that the front of the body is in a crouched position with the front legs lower than the back legs. This can indicate a higher level of aggression that can be the precursor to an attack. If this position is accompanied by snarling, a wrinkled nose, dilated pupils, the tail tucked under the body and between the back legs, and the raised hair on the dog's back, the dog is highly aggressive and fearful.<ref name = dogmag>{{cite web|url=http://moderndogmagazine.com/articles/how-read-your-dogs-body-language/415|title=How To Read Your Dog's Body Language|publisher= Dog Magazine | access-date = May 4, 2017}}</ref>

Though a dog approaching another dog or a person is not necessarily going to bite, there are some methods to reduce the likelihood that the encounter will not result in a bite. Many organizations have published materials to educate children and adults on what reactions will reduce the risk of being bitten. Some of these recommendations are to:
* Stop walking or moving.
* Stay still and be calm.
* Do not panic or make loud noises.
* Avoid direct eye contact with the dog.
* Say ""No"" or ""Go Home"" in a firm, deep voice.
* Stand with the side of your body facing the dog. 
* Avoid facing a dog directly since it can appear aggressive to the dog. 
* keep your body turned partially or completely to the side.
* Slowly raise your hands to your neck, with your elbows in.
* Wait for the dog to pass or slowly back away.<ref name = CDC2015/>

== Injury prevention ==
It is possible to reduce not only the risk of being attacked, but also to minimize injury from the attack.
* Put your purse, bag, or jacket between you and the dog to protect yourself.
* If you are knocked down, curl into a ball with your head tucked in and your hands over your ears and neck.
* When you get to a safe place, immediately wash wounds with soap and water. Seek medical attention, especially:
* Call the doctor if the wound is serious (uncontrolled bleeding, loss of function, extreme pain, muscle or bone exposure, etc.), if the wound becomes red, painful, warm, or swollen, or if you develop a fever, or if it has been more than 5 years since your last tetanus shot and the bite is deep.<ref name = CDC2015/>
* Train the dog.
* Educate children on dog bite prevention. <ref name = AMA2017/>

== Infection prevention ==
Acquiring an infection from a dog that has bitten a person can also occur. Preventing such an infection is possible with treatment.
* Apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding.
* If you cannot stop the bleeding or you feel faint or weak, call 911 or your local emergency medical services immediately.
* Seek treatment from a healthcare provider immediately

Because anyone who is bitten by an unvaccinated dog is at risk of getting rabies, local animal control agencies or police are sometimes able to capture the animal and determine whether or not it is infected with rabies, report the incident. This is important if the dog appears sick or is acting strangely.<ref name = CDC2015> {{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/dog-bite-prevention/index.html | date = May 18, 2015 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Preventing Dog Bites | access-date = April 25, 2017}} {{PD-notice}} {{CDC}}</ref>
<!--What diseases can you get from dog bites?

In addition to causing injury, dog bites can spread germs from dogs to people. On average, up to 18% of dog bites become infected with bacteria. Over 60 different kinds of bacteria have been found in dog mouths, but only a handful of these germs can make you sick. You should be aware of the following diseases that can result from dog bites:

Rabies is one of the most serious diseases people can get from dog bites. Although getting rabies from a dog in the United States is rare, rabies is a disease that you should be aware of. Rabies is a virus that affects the brain and is almost always fatal. The most common way rabies virus is spread is through the bite and saliva of an infected animal. The disease can be prevented by vaccinating dogs. People who are exposed to a dog or any animal that could have rabies should receive treatment immediately to prevent rabies.
Capnocytophaga spp. are bacteria that live in the mouths of humans, dogs, and cats. These bacteria do not make dogs or cats sick. Rarely, Capnocytophaga spp. can spread to humans through bites, scratches, or close contact from a dog or cat and cause illness. Most people who have contact with dogs or cats do not become sick. People with a weakened immune system (making it more difficult for their bodies to fight infection) are at greater risk of becoming sick.
Pasteurella is a type of bacteria seen in over 50% of infected dog bite wounds. Pasteurella commonly causes a painful, red infection at the site of the bite but can cause more serious disease in people with a weak immune system. Often these signs are accompanied by swollen glands, swelling in the joints, and difficulty moving.
MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is type of Staph infection that is resistant to a certain group of antibiotics. Dogs and other animals can carry MRSA without showing any symptoms, but the bacteria can cause skin, lung, and urinary tract infections in people. In some people, MRSA can spread to the bloodstream or lungs and cause life-threatening infections.
Tetanus is a toxin produced by a type of bacteria called Clostridium tetani. This toxin causes rigid paralysis in people and could be a problem in deep bite wounds.<ref name = CDC2015/>-->

== Tail ==
The tail of a dog can communicate a number of emotions and intentions.<ref name = dogmag/>
[[Tail wagging by dogs]] is familiar to those who interact with them. Considerable effort has been put in to describing this aspect of dog behavior. When a dog wags its tail, most people interpret this as the dog expressing [[happiness]] and [[friendliness]]. Though indeed tail wagging can express these positive emotions, tall wagging is also an indication of [[fear]], [[emotional insecurity | insecurity]], the challenging of [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]], establishing [[socialization|social relationships]] or a [[warning sign]] that the dog may bite.

== Ears ==
When a dog has its ears erect but not facing forward, this can mean that the dog is relaxed and can be approached. When the ears are erect and directed forward, this may indicate that the dog is in an increased state of alertness or may be curious. When a dog flattens its ears, pointed backward (if it can) this may indicate fear, aggressiveness, stress, being worried, or submission <ref name = dogmag>{{cite web|url=http://moderndogmagazine.com/articles/how-read-your-dogs-body-language/415|title=How To Read Your Dog's Body Language|publisher= Dog Magazine | access-date = May 4, 2017}}</ref>

==Head and body==
A dog communicates by altering the position of its head. When the head is held in an erect position this could indicate that is approachable, attentive, curious, or aggression. The body position that a dog has is also an indicator of what the dog is communicating. The head can be held in a high position convey being approachable, alert, aggressive, or displaying dominance. The dog can alter its body position so that the front of the body is in a crouched position with the front legs lower than the back legs. This can indicate a higher level of aggression that can be the precursor to an attack. If this position is accompanied by snarling, a wrinkled nose, dilated pupils, the tail tucked under the body and between the back legs, and the raised hair on the dog's back, the dog is highly aggressive and fearful.   <ref name = dogmag/>

<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
A '''dog bite''' is a bite inflicted upon a person, a group of persons or another animal by a dog. One or more successive bites is often considered a '''dog attack'''. The majority of dog bites do not result in [[injury]], disfigurement, infection or permanent [[ disability]]. Another type of dog bite is the 'soft bite' displayed by well-trained dogs, [[puppies]] and in non-aggressive play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/issues/13_6/features/Bite-Inhibition_16232-1.html|title=Reinforce Your Dog's Bite Inhibition - Whole Dog Journal|website=www.whole-dog-journal.com}}</ref> Situations in which dog bites occur include [[dog fight]]ing, [[animal abuse | mistreatment]], trained dogs acting as guard or military animals, [[provocation|provoked]] or unprovoked.<ref name = Weiss2001/> 

<!-- Cause -->
There is considerable debate on whether or not certain [[dog breed|breeds of dogs]] are inherently more prone to commit attacks causing serious injury (i.e., so driven by instinct and breeding that, under certain circumstances, they are exceedingly likely to attempt or commit dangerous attacks). Regardless of the breed of the dog, it is recognized that the risk of dangerous dog attacks can be greatly increased by human actions (such as neglect or fight training) or inactions (as carelessness in confinement and control).

<!-- Epidemiology -->

===Breeds===
All dog breeds can inflict a bite.<ref name=AFP2014/> Breed is not an accurate predictor of whether or not a dog will bite.<ref name=avma2014/> In the US [[pit bull]]-type and [[Rottweilers]] most frequently are identified breeds in cases of severe bites.<ref name=AFP2014/><ref name=avma2014>{{cite web |url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Pages/The-Role-of-Breed-in-Dog-Bite-Risk-and-Prevention.aspx |publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association  |title=Dog Bite Risk and Prevention: The Role of Breed |date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> This may be due to their size. These breeds are more frequently owned by people involved in crime.<ref name=avma2014/>

From 2000 to 2009, media accounts were compared with reports available from animal control officials. It was determined that in a sample of 256 dog bite-related fatalities, breed could only be validly determined in 45 cases, and the attacks in these 45 cases were dispersed among 20 different breeds and 2 known mixes.  For a further set of 401 dogs in media accounts of dog bite-related fatalities, breed determination differed between different media accounts of the same attack 31% of the time, factoring in animal control accounts produced disagreement on breed for 40% of attacks.<ref name=""Patronek_et_al"">{{cite journal| last1 = Patronek | first1 = Gary J. | last2 = Sacks | first2 = Jeffrey J. | last3 = Delise | first3 = Karen M. | last4 = Cleary | first4 = Donald V. | last5 = Marder | first5 = Amy R. | title = Co-occurrence of potentially preventable factors in 256 dog bite–related fatalities in the United States (2000–2009) | journal = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association | volume = 243 | issue = 12 | pages = 1726–1736 | publisher = American Veterinary Medical Association | location = Schaumburg, Illinois, USA | date = 15 December 2013 | url = http://avmajournals.avma.org/doi/abs/10.2460/javma.243.12.1726?journalCode=javma | doi = 10.2460/javma.243.12.1726 | pmid=24299544}}</ref>

A 2000 study by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports of 327 people killed by dogs ""[[pit bull terrier]]"" or mixes thereof were reportedly involved in 76 cases.

==Prevention==
[[File:Pit bull restrained.jpg|thumb| a muzzled dog]]
{{Main|Dog bite prevention}}
Legislative bodies have addressed concerns about dog bites that include licensing laws, statutes outlawing  organized dogfights, and leash laws. Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL), has been enacted in some areas limiting the ownership and activities of dogs perceived to be more likely to bite and attack.<ref>https://www.animallaw.info/statute/fl-dogs-florida-dog-dangerous-dog-laws#s11</ref><ref>https://www.animallaw.info/statute/mi-dangerous-chapter-287-animal-industry-dangerous-animals</ref><ref>https://www.animallaw.info/statute/oh-dog-chapter-955-dogs-consolidated-dog-laws#s11</ref><ref>https://www.animallaw.info/statute/mn-dangerous-minnesota-dangerous-dog-definitions-dog-bites-rabies-treatments</ref> This breed specific regulations are usually directed toward those animals perceived to be Rottweilers, American Staffordshire Bull Terriers (""Pit Bulls""), Chow Chows, German Shepherd Dogs, and Doberman Pinschers, ""breeds traditionally known as 'dangerous,' or those that have demonstrated particular propensities for aggression and violent behavior"". Though effective in reducing the number of bites and attacks from dogs, such prevention measures are often opposed by dog owners. To prevent dog bites, some regulations intend to make the owner liable for bites of their dogs.<ref name = Weiss2001/>

Other measures in preventing dog bites are signage (""Beware of Dog"") and locked dog enclosures.<ref name = Weiss2001/> Dog owners often oppose protective regulations in the courts claiming either that the regulations will not prevent bites and attacks and/or their rights as dog owners are being infringed.<ref>https://www.animallaw.info/case/american-dog-owners-assn-inc-v-dade-county-fla</ref><ref>https://www.animallaw.info/case/dog-federation-wisconsin-inc-v-city-south-milwaukee</ref><ref>https://www.animallaw.info/case/american-dog-owners-assn-inc-v-city-lynn</ref>

Human activities may increase the risk of a dog bite as does age, height, and movement. The CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association have published recommendations which encourage those that are around dogs to:

* not run from a dog.
* Remain motionless when approached by an unfamiliar dog.
* Curl into a ball, while protecting your head and ears if knocked over.
* not panic or make loud noises.
* Report dogs that are behaving strangely.
* Do not disturb a dog that is caring for puppies.
* not pet a strange dog 
* not encourage your dog to play aggressively.
* not allow small children to play with a dog unsupervised.<ref name = CDC2015/>
* Avoid the family dog if it is ill
* Avoid waking the dog, call the dog by name
* Avoid retrieving objects from the dog's mouth
* Avoid face-to-face interaction with the dog
* not disturb the dog while the animal is eating.
* reduce the dog's interaction with children<ref name = AMA2017> {{cite web | title = Dog Bite Prevention |publisher = American Veterinary Medical Association  | date = 2017 | access-date = May 5, 2017 | url = https://www.avma.org/public/Pages/Dog-Bite-Prevention.aspx }}</ref>

=== Dog behavior ===
In isolation, [[man-eater|predatory behaviors]] are rarely the cause of an attack on a human. Predatory aggression is more commonly involved as a contributing factor for example in attacks by multiple dogs; a ""pack kill instinct"" may arise if multiple dogs are involved in an attack.<ref>http://www.shepardhavenlaw.com/stop-a-dog-fight/#tips Tips for Stopping a Dog Fight</ref>

==Treatment==
[[File:Dog bite stapled.jpg|thumb|A common veterinary treatment for a dog biting another dog is to shave the fur, clean the wound, and put in a staple.]]
The risk of a serious infection can be reduced by cleaning the wound and getting appropriate health care treatment.

Local animal control agencies or police are sometimes able to capture the animal and determine whether or not it is infected with rabies. This is important if the dog appears sick or is acting strangely.<ref name = CDC2015> {{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/dog-bite-prevention/index.html | date = May 18, 2015 | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title = Preventing Dog Bites | access-date = April 25, 2017}} {{CDC}}</ref>

patients bitten by dogs needed treatment for lacerations and 5.5% of all those treated required an operation to make repairs. Very young children (infants) were more than six times more likely to bitten by a family pet and over six times more likely to sustain injuries in their neck and head. Children aged five and younger needed treatment and repair 62% of the time. Those dogs identified as Pit bulls were implicated in 50% of the bites needing surgical treatment of the child.

<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Rabies in Haiti''' is the [[viral disease]] rabies that causes an often fatal [[encephalitis|inflammation of the brain]] in humans and other [[mammals]] dogs and mongooses in Haiti.<ref name = WHO2017/> Rabies got its name from a Latin word that means ""to rage"".<ref name = cdckids/> That's because animals with rabies sometimes act as if they are angry. Early symptoms can include fever and tingling at the site of exposure.<ref name = WHO2017/> These are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and [[loss of consciousness]].<ref name=WHO2017/> Once symptoms appear, the result is nearly always death.<ref name=WHO2017/> The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however, this time period can vary from less than one week to more than one year.<ref name=WHO2017/> The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the [[central nervous system]].<ref name = WHO2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/|title=Rabies|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=""Rupp2015"">{{cite journal|last1=Rupprecht|first1=Charles E|last2=Millien|first2=Max F.|last3=Pierre-Louis|first3=Jocelyne B.|last4=Wallace|first4=Ryan|last5=Caldas|first5=Eduardo|last6=Rwangabgoba|first6=Jean M.|last7=Poncelet|first7=Jean L.|last8=Cosivi|first8=Ottorino|last9=Del Rio Vilas|first9=Victor J.|title=Control of Dog Mediated Human Rabies in Haiti: No Time to Spare|journal=PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=9|issue=6|year=2015|pages=e0003806|issn=1935-2735|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>

Haiti is one of five remaining countries in the Americas where canine rabies is still a problem and has the highest rate of human rabies deaths in the western hemisphere with an estimated 2 deaths each week. Only about 7 deaths are reported to health authorities each year due to poor surveillance, limitations in diagnostic capacity, and lack of awareness and education about the disease among Haitians.<ref name = CDCrabies/>

In 2013, CDC and its partners began an animal rabies surveillance program in several regions in Haiti, and saw an 18-fold rise in detection of rabid animals. In 2015, CDC evaluated Haiti’s canine rabies vaccination program and found that only 45 percent of dogs were vaccinated as a result of the campaign, far short of the 70 percent needed to stop rabies spreading in the dog population. In addition, the researchers found that Haiti has nearly 1 million dogs, twice as many as previously thought.<ref name = CDCrabies/>

CDC and its partners had already begun a dog vaccination trial evaluating the best vaccination methods for Haiti. As part of this effort, they have vaccinated 3,000 dogs in just 4 days in the summer of 2016, and plan to vaccinate a total of 8,000 dogs as part of this campaign.<ref name = CDCrabies>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/worldrabiesday/haiti.html|title=Rabies in Haiti - World Rabies Day - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=8 May 2017}}{{CDC}}</ref>

The first dose of the four-dose course for those who are unvaccinated,is administered immediately after exposure to the rabies virus. Additional doses are given on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. Exposure usually means a bite from a rapid animal.<ref name = cdctreatment>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/vaccine.html|title=CDC - Medical Care: Rabies Vaccine - Rabies|accessdate=8 May 2017}} {{CDC}}</ref>

Post Exposure Prophylaxis At the individual patient level, post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of i) local treatment of the wound, ii) vaccination, and iii) administration of immunoglobulin (if indicated) [3]. At the programme level, several components are critical to this capacity: i) adequate and prompt recognition of the need of PEP by the public, if exposed, and by health officials, ii) prompt and sufficient availability of PEP of quality, and iii) adequate follow-up of PEP use. Awareness by health officials of the need of PEP after a dog bite can only be achieved via timely and spatially relevant communication efforts about the epidemiological situation of rabies.

==Epidemiology ==
Globally, 59,000 people die from rabies each year or one person every 9 minutes. Half of the people who die from rabies are under the age of 15.<ref name = cdckids>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/rabiesandkids/facts.html|title=Get the Facts - CDC Rabies and Kids|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=9 May 2017}}{{CDC}}</ref> The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Pan American Center of foot-and-mouth disease (PANAFTOSA) led a mission to eliminate dog-mediated rabies in the American region by 2015. These organizations are cognizant on the regional control of rabies. The PAHO and PANAFTOSA visited Haiti in early December 2013. The objectives of the mission were to assess the status of Haiti’s rabies program as delivered by the Haitian  Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR)  and MSPP. The mission was to seek opportunities for collaboration between Haiti, Brazil, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Haiti.<ref name=""Rupp2015""/>

Even in 2017, rabies in Haiti has been identified as still being a national problem with pre-exposure prophylaxis proposed.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/3/17-000317.pdf | title=In this month’s Bulletin|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=95|issue=3|year=2017|pages=165–165|issn=0042-9686|doi=10.2471/BLT.17.000317}}</ref>
<!--The American region has pledged to eliminate dog-mediated human rabies by 2015. As part of these efforts, we describe the findings of a desk and field mission review of Haiti’s rabies situation by the end of 2013. While government officials recognize the importance dog-mediated rabies control, and the national rabies plan adequately contemplates the basic capacities to that effect, regular and sufficient implementation, for example, of dog vaccination, is hampered by limited funding.-->

==Animal immunization==
Dog Vaccination Dog vaccination remains the most efficient mechanism for the control of dog-mediated rabies as seen throughout the American region where medical authorities have achieved rabies control.

Vaccination failures, e.g., in the form of disruption of annual campaigns or insufficient coverage, have been pointed out as the main cause for reoccurrence of dog rabies and sustained failure to control the disease. In Haiti, dog vaccination has been inconsistently applied. The last mass vaccination campaign was funded and conducted in 2012 by the MARNDR. Approximately 400,000 dogs were vaccinated. For a cur-rent human population of approximately 10 million, assuming a relation of one dog per 10 people and aiming to attain 70% of vaccine coverage, 700,000 dogs would have to be vaccinated. The lack of reliable dog population figures (estimates range from 800,000 to 1,200,000 million dogs) makes the assessment of the efficacy of the vaccination campaign difficult, although the persistence of rabid dogs in 2013, as explicitly shown by the CDC figures (above),provides some indication of its limited efficacy.


Surveillance figures not accurately reflect the risk to people as evidenced by the large number of rabid dogs detected by focalized and enhanced surveillance activities conducted by the '''Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development (MARNDR) and the Health and Population Ministry (MSPP) with the technical assistance of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although inter-national support is common, either in the form of on-the-ground technical support or donations of immunological, it is not comprehensive. In addition, there is limited coordination with Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development MSPP and with other actors at the strategic or operational level due to human resources limitations. Given these findings, the 2015 elimination goal in the region is compromised by the situation in Haiti where control of the disease is not yet in sight despite the best efforts of the resolute national officials. More importantly, dog-mediated rabies is still a threat to the Haitian population.

Surveillance Rabies surveillance and diagnosis in dogs constitutes the main focus of CDC activities in Haiti.Specifically, on diagnosis, the CDC, in collaboration with the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission, has trained, to date, more than 20 MARNDR laboratory personnel in rabies diagnostic methods (Direct Fluorescent Antibody [DFA] and Direct Rapid Immunohistochemistry Test[dRIT]), and improved a diagnostic laboratory in Port-au-Prince with advanced diagnostic equipment. Animal rabies surveillance activities follow a bite-reporting model in which the public and medical providers report bite events to rabies control officers. To support these activities, more than 30 field veterinary and health agents received training in rabies surveillance.

In 2011, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development ,the CDC initiated a five year rabies infrastructure improvement programme focusing on three critical areas of canine rabies control: surveillance, diagnostics, and education. Collaborations with the MSPP to improve public education on rabies and human rabies surveillance are also ongoing. With a gross-national-income per-capita of<US$1,035, Haiti is the only country in the American region that is part of the group of low income countries. The other 33 low income countries, as classified by the World Bank, are in Africa and Asia, where dog-transmitted rabies is also endemic and results in thousands of deaths annually. Weak governance and limited resources appear well linked to the persistence of dog rabies.

Rabies control officers, in turn, attempt to locate the offending animal and conduct a rabies assessment. Animals involved in a bite event are either euthanized and tested or quarantined for 14 days in the owner’s home. Animals reported due to signs of rabies, regardless of human exposure, are tested as well. 

This passive animal rabies surveillance programme is currently restricted to two of the ten geographical departments of the country (West and Artibo-nite), chosen primarily for security reasons, and that contribute approximately 50% of Haitian population. To support activities on the field, the CDC and the NGO Christian Veteri-nary Mission maintain four Haitian staff in the West Department and three in the Artibonite Department, respectively. The results of these efforts are starting to show the level of under-reporting of canine rabies. Official statistics reported six cases of rabid dogs in 2012 (as of early December 2012) for the country.

This compares with 42 rabid dogs identified by the passive surveillance program in just three communities in Port-au-Prince during the first nine months of the establishment of this surveillance system in 2012.There is no laboratory-based surveillance of human rabies in Haiti. All diagnoses are based on clinical history. This is due to the current lack of dedicated laboratory facilities for the diagnosis of human rabies, which also impedes the identification of the virus variants and severely limits the evidence available to inform the epidemiology of the disease in the country. Public aversion to autopsy and insufficient numbers of pathologists for collection of samples also limits human rabies surveillance. Alternative, less invasive routes for specimen collection, which may include the transforamen magnum or trans-orbital route, as well via skin and hair folli-cles at the nape of the neck for immunofluorescent staining for viral antigen detection may merit study.

==Challenges==
Haiti is also the only country in the region where control of canine rabies is not led by the Ministry of Health (MSPP in Haiti), but by the MARNDR. The MSPP manages health care and rabies prevention in the human population. This separation of responsibilities demands good coordination to ensure,for example, that rabies cases in humans and dogs are communicated between the two Minis-tries to initiate exhaustive investigations to identify the source of exposure and to implement effective and prompt control measures to prevent further enzootic and cross species transmission.

Experience elsewhere shows that this is difficult enough within departments of the same ministry (e.g., health care and epidemiology). A comprehensive evaluation of Haiti’s rabies programme should start by assessing the costs and benefits of this separation of responsibilities between the two ministries.Rabies Control Programme: Basic Capacities. An effective rabies control programme requires a number of basic capacities that support inter-ventions at the animal and human fronts. We describe those of Haiti following the structure suggested by [4]. We merely use this scheme to better structure the findings of our mission,and stop short of quantifying the different levels of performance within the capacities as this would have required a much longer mission. 

Although canine mass vaccination was planned for 2013, no vaccination campaign was con-ducted. Haitian authorities relied on funds donated by the World Bank for the purchase ofapproximately 500,000 doses of inactivated, injectable vaccine (IMRAB by Merial). Although the funds were awarded in April 2013, the vaccine only arrived in 2014. At the time of writing(November 2014), dog vaccination was finally underway. It started in September 2014 and isexpected to terminate in January 2015. This four month period for the completion of the cam-paign responds purely to the lack of enough manpower to deliver a faster implementation.

==Section one and intro==
The Context PAHO’s regional programme of rabies control defines Haiti as a priority country, i.e., countries where canine rabies variants are either circulating or did so in the recent past. The context and capacities of priority countries are diverse, and efforts are undergoing to evaluate the best port-folio of actions to address country-specific limitations [2]. Brazil, for example, remains a priority country because of the persistent, albeit well-circumscribed, occurrence of dog-mediated human rabies in the northeast of the country, in the state of Maranhao [3]. Even with this occurrence,

=='''Brazil'''==
remains a successful example in the control of dog-mediated rabies, and constitutes an important technical reference in the region. With the aim of promoting south-to-south collaboration, the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the ministry solely responsible for the control of dog-transmitted rabies in the country, assisted PAHO’s mission to Haiti. Specifically on rabies, Brazil has donated human and canine vaccines to Haiti in the past. One of the objectives of the PAHO mission was to explore ways to enhance this collaboration, for example, in the form of direct technical assistance on the ground. Such assistance would complement the activities currently conducted by the CDC. 





To help with this basic capacity, the CDC has conveyed to the MSPP its willingness to assist in human sample collection, shipping of samples, and diagnostic testing at CDC’s  rabies laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, US. To date, only one sample has been shipped to the CDC, which tested negative for rabies.At a meeting during the mission, MSPP officials reported three human cases in 2013, eightin 2012, 13 in 2011, and one in 2010, all allegedly due to canine rabies. These numbers indicate severe under-reporting when compared with modeling figures that show Haiti as the main contributor of the estimated 200 human deaths by dog-transmitted rabies per year in the region[3]. The above structural limitations do not extend to animal samples that are analysed at the MARNDR rabies laboratory.

Tosupport the vaccination campaign, MARNDR is implementing a solar-powered cold chain(Fig 1), over and above the available cold chain facilities in MSPP field premises, previouslyused to support dog vaccination campaigns.
==sec==
On this note, dogbites are now, together with six notifiable conditions, part of the daily reporting requirements from 114 health units (out of more than 900 in the country) to a central epidemiology unit in Port-au-Prince, the capital. This intensive reporting pressure on health officials should increase rabies awareness across the health system, and lead to an increase in the number of dog attacks reported. The aggregation of this information, analysis, and feedback to the sources on a regu-lar basis would further improve awareness among health officials of the rabies risks.As reported by health officials, 1,657 dog bites were recorded in 2013 by the 114 sentinelhealth centers. For a population of approximately 10 million people, this results in a 0.016% of the population bitten by dogs; five times lower than the 0.08% average reported by the coun-tries that attended the 14thmeeting of National Rabies Programme Managers (REDIPRA inSpanish) in Lima (Perú) in 2013 [7], and many more times lower than the 1.8% reported inother countries where canine rabies is also endemic [8]. Analyses of the number of animalaggressions reported by the public may inform the level of awareness within the populationwith regard to the risk of rabies. A simple and short questionnaire about the motivation of thevisit by the dog bitten patient, i.e., whether it was related to fear of rabies, could be administeredto refine this inference. Further checks on the quality of the data should help explain apparentreporting artifacts, such as the fact that all registered victims of dog attacks were five years oldor older, a finding that challenges results elsewhere that consistently report young children asPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20154 / 10

the main victims of dog bites [9,10,11]. The surveillance artifact may hide greater under-reporting of rabies cases if this population group is not captured by the bite registration mecha-nisms, and should trigger questions as to where do children younger than five years old go forbite treatment.At the time of the review, the MSPP had more than 15,000 doses of human vaccine for PEPin stock. These vaccines belonged to a lot of 20,000 Vero cell rabies vaccines for intramuscularadministration donated by Brazil in 2013. This volume of vaccine should be enough to coverthe needs of the country for at least two years given the current use rate of 8,000 doses per year.In addition to sufficient numbers, vaccine must be stored in adequate conditions and in such away that allows its prompt availability across the country.

A national consultant hired byPAHO/Haiti visited twelve sites in Port-au-Prince during the last months of 2013 and reportedadequate cold chain. We had no data about the conditions outside the capital.At an annual use rate of 8,000 human vaccine doses (as per PAHO/Haiti’s warehouse rec-ords), the country could face a surplus of several thousand doses by the end of their shelf life inearly 2015. Solutions to the adequate use of this potential excess of vaccine, before they reachtheir expiration date, might contemplate increasing the distribution of vaccine to areas where itis not currently available, e.g., outside the capital. According to MSPP officials, all large hospi-tals in the country (between 40 and 50) had stocks of human vaccine. Ensuring that vaccineFig 1.

regimens after exposure are taken fully by as many patients as possible is also critical. MSPPofficials confirmed that they do not record this key performance indicator. At the time of the mission, the amount and availability of any stock of immunoglobulin was not ascertained.Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis The 2013 WHO expert consultation on rabies report [3] indicates the administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis for those populations at continuous or high risk of rabies, especially children. Although the current stock of vaccine could support such strategy, and indirectly reduce the potential surplus of vaccine by 2015, the logistics of the distribution, rationale for application, and the required follow-up would make this operation impossible given the current avail-able resources.Outbreak Control Activities This capacity comprises surveillance, awareness raising, and control specific activities, within a defined time and space context, implemented following the confirmation of a case of rabies.These can include enhanced surveillance of animal populations at risk, ring vaccination, and awareness campaigns for the population. The rabies national plan provides protocols to guarantee the exchange of information between MSPP and the MARNDR after the occurrence of rabies events. 

For example, the communication of dog attacks by the MSPP to the MARNDR,for the latter to initiate surveillance and control activities, occurs after a number of dog attacks are recorded for a specific area. At the time of this review, it was not possible to ascertain the criteria, e.g., number of dogs and period of time that trigger this communication, nor was it possible to verify the completeness of epidemiological reports around the cases.Reactive vaccination of susceptible animals after confirmation of rabies within the local community is also part of these case control activities, however, the amount of canine vaccine available for this purpose at the time of the mission, around 1,000 doses, appeared insufficient. Education Rabies educational capacity comprises activities towards health professionals and the general public to enhance and maintain awareness of rabies risks. 

==sec==

To this end, the MSPP conducted a training activity for 40 health officials of the central region on PEP in 2013. This training fol-lowed four similar courses delivered in 2012. It was not possible to ascertain if these activities were all part of a training plan.MSPP and PAHO/Haiti officials stated the critical importance of training for health official son PEP, data form completion, etc., and stressed the ongoing need for these activities given thehigh staff turnover. Training on PEP application should help to change the current practice of delaying prophylaxis after exposure if the animal can be observed. This practice can lead to fatal delays [3] and it needs to be replaced with the immediate application of PEP after expo-sure even if the animal can be observed.For MARNDR officials, there are currently no training plans, although the CDC trained more than 30 veterinary officials in June 2013, and delivers regular training to personnel of theMARNDR laboratory responsible for rabies diagnosis.Identification of Other Risks Cases of canine rabies together with the significant numbers of mongoose cases reported from the Dominican Republic could be seen as a threat to Haiti’s rabies status [7]. Despite this beinga genuine concern, and an indication of a source of rabies in Haiti’s wildlife, it is not high in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20156 / 10

the list of priorities given the many limitations affecting the other capacities. Any medium- orlong-term strategy in the future must contemplate the wildlife source. In the short term,enhanced communication and coordination of control efforts with the neighbouring Domini-can Republic would bring benefits to the two countries.DiscussionDespite having a National Rabies Plan for the period 2007–2012, and an evaluation of it in2011, little of the plan could be delivered due to insufficient resources at the MSPP andMARNDR. Whereas in other countries in the region the main interest resides on how rabiescontrol activities are operationalised, as the focus is on the optimization of well-establishedprocesses, in Haiti this is not the case, as some basic rabies capacities are still wanting. This istrue for the episodic mass canine vaccination campaigns, and the lack of diagnostic facilitiesfor human rabies cases. Given that canine vaccination is the most effective measure to controldog-mediated human rabies, the intermittent nature of the mass campaigns and their insuffi-cient coverage will not allow for the control of the disease any time soon, let alone itselimination.The inconsistent and insufficient canine vaccination campaigns will also stop short of deliv-ering a number of related positive effects associated with vaccination, e.g., increased awarenessin the population due to the high visibility of the campaigns, and a sense of purpose among theofficials responsible for rabies control. Not only that, the ongoing occurrence of dog cases dueto low levels of immunity in the population, despite large logistic efforts, can easily lead to frus-tration among officials and hamper participation by the population [12].Following recommendations from the 14thREDIPRA meeting [7] canine rabies vaccine hasbeen recently added to PAHO’s Revolving Fund (RF). Countries in the region can now requestcanine vaccine from the RF.

==sec==
Despite the advantages provided by the inclusion of the caninevaccine in the RF, e.g., consistent vaccine quality and more competitive prices, the evidence tosupport the allocation of funds within the MSPP and MARNDR to purchase rabies vaccine isnot sufficient. This evidence can only be gathered by means of adequate surveillance to informthe burden of rabies against that of other diseases.Although there are models that estimate a much larger number of human rabies cases inHaiti [3], these cases remain unobserved, and lead to no reaction by the already overstretchedand under-resourced Haitian health system. This appears logical as the impact of these esti-mated, but unobserved, cases is difficult to demonstrate relative to that of other conditions thatprovide counts of actual data and lead to health care expenditure. Disease estimates adjustedfor under-ascertainment trigger little policy action [13], at least at the operational level, and arenot a substitute for actual surveillance data. The dog surveillance work conducted by theMARNDR with technical support by the CDC is, therefore, critical. Short of reliable records onthe real count of human rabies cases, measures of rabies risk approximated by the dog surveil-lance figures, in combination with dog bite data, can provide an indication of the much higherlevel of rabies exposure in the population.Surveillance findings need to be disseminated to attain their objective: inform and influencedecision, at as many levels as possible. There is value in reporting back to the sources of data for awareness and motivation reasons, to local authorities to inform strategic and operationaldecisions pertaining to the rabies programme, and to international forums to raise awareness about the situation in Haiti. To this end, Haiti should return to the regular reporting of surveil-lance figures and details of the cases to the regional database on rabies (SIRVERA) held atPANAFTOSA [6]. By having up-to-date data by country and aggregated figures, PAHO canreport progress towards the goal of elimination in the region, and identify countries in need ofPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20157 / 10

==sec==

greater focus, such as Haiti. At this critical stage in the race to elimination, with fewer cases and diminishing resources and available skill pool in the region, collecting and sharing as much information as possible on the epidemiology and, critically, on the processes leading to the surveillance and control of the disease remains as important as ever.Following from the recommendations of the last REDIPRA meeting [7], PAHO coordinated in 2014 a proficiency exercise for 35 laboratories from 23 countries to assess regional consistency in direct fluorescent antibody techniques.


Haiti’s MARNDR reference laboratory has participated in this exercise. This shows the commitment of the Haitian authorities to improve their processes. This willingness should be extended to seek the utilization of the MARNDR laboratory premises for the diagnoses of human rabies cases, over and above legitimate administrative and organizational concerns. On this note, as of July 2014, there is discussion about developing a plan for a joint human and animal rabies diagnostic facility in the North Depart-ment. If successful, this will represent the second animal rabies diagnostic facility and first human rabies diagnostic facility in the country. The initiative to create a joint human/animal rabies diagnostic laboratory would maximize the use of the limited human resource and infra-structure capital. Given the current low recognition of human rabies, and the fact that the majority of routine diagnostic testing will be on animal samples, it is not feasible to create diagnostic facility solely devoted to human diagnostics, nor train personnel in human rabies diagnostics alone.

==Brazil again==
The Brazilian Ministry of Health is willing to consider far-reaching and more effective ways of collaborating with Haiti, extending the ad-hoc donations of vaccine to on-the-ground technical support on areas such as vaccine campaigns planning and delivery, PEP training to health officials, and others. Brazil’s technical contribution will only add to the increasing need to provide a strategic framework, with clear objectives, i.e., the control of the disease in the canine population first to ensure the efficient elimination of dog mediated human cases, and coordination between donors.The impact of international technical missions like the one reported here appears reduced,at least in terms of observing rapid changes in response to limitations that are well known by the local officials.


The benefit could come in the form of notes like this and their dissemination:to increase awareness among international donors, senior authorities in Haiti, and within PAHO. A planned communication campaign is just one of the activities contained in the strategic document, being drafted at the time of writing, to support a rabies task force in Haiti. Keyto this strategy, and responding to a critical lack of this capacity, is the need for coordination among the multiple partners that deliver rabies activities in Haiti. Better integration among partners should lead to greater impact and more efficient use of resources. Coordination and speaking with one voice before Haitian authorities would also increase the critical mass of rabies control efforts and deliver a more consistent and rotund message. The funding of a rabies coordinator/rabies champion, who will work primarily towards ensuring regular and sufficient canine vaccination campaigns and prompt availability of human vaccine for the next two to three years, is being discussed at the time of writing.

The current situation in Haiti clearly impacts on the region’s 2015 elimination goal [1]. This will not be achieved. The countries of the region will have to discuss and agree on a new goal that recognizes the distinct situations across the region, and strategies to that effect. Most of the countries and areas, where dog-mediated human rabies is no longer a public health problem, will benefit from strategies oriented to efficiency gains and enhanced knowledge management to ensure institutional memory and experience dissemination. These efforts should also benefit the reduced number of countries and areas, such as Haiti, where rabies remains a public health concern. Specific plans for dog rabies control, such as those described above for Haiti,will require contributions from a number of regional partners and neighboring countries.

forthcoming 2015 REDIPRA meeting will provide the platform to hold these discussions and agree on a new regional goal.A general limitation of the findings described here is that they originate from unstructured questions, observations, and notes from meetings and field visits. A more comprehensive plat-form to collect precise information on the levels of performance within the capacities, as well as on process-related indicators, is the subject of current work by PANAFTOSA.--><ref name=""FenelonDely2017"">{{cite journal|last1=Fenelon|first1=N.|last2=Dely|first2=P.|last3=Katz|first3=M.

[[Image:WOODHEYS CATTERY - Southern Cattery.jpg|thumb|right|Woodheys Cattery]]
A '''cattery''' is where [[cat]]s are commercially housed.

Catteries come in two varieties - boarding catteries and breeding catteries.

== Boarding cattery ==
{{globalize/UK|section|date=November 2013}}
[[Image:Rockwell Cattery - geograph.org.uk - 425851.jpg|thumb|right|Rockwell Cattery]]
A boarding cattery is where cats are housed temporarily, when they cannot stay at their owners' home. Boarding catteries (cat boarding kennels) are mostly used by owners who are away on holiday, although they may also be used during house moves, building work or when their owners are incapacitated, for example if they have to go into hospital.

Cats must be adequately looked after, otherwise the owner(s) of the cattery may face legal action by the law or cat protection bodies such as the [[RSPCA]] if the owner(s) of the cat feel that it be necessary.

All establishments boarding cats within the [[United Kingdom]] are required to be licensed and inspected by the [[local authority]]'s [[Environmental Health]] department under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/43/enacted Animal Boarding Establishments Act 1963.] Licensed establishments will have a copy of their licence prominently displayed as part of their conditions of licence].

A [[veterinary surgeon]] (vet) will not be deemed to keep a boarding establishment for cats so long as the cat is at the time receiving treatment by the veterinary surgeon and the boarding is a requirement of the treatment. 
 
A vet will be deemed to be keeping a boarding establishment if, at the time of boarding, the cat is not under treatment or required to board as part of that treatment. If the boarding facility is advertised as ancillary to the vet's main business, the establishment will need to be licensed and inspected by their [[local authority]] and meet the conditions as per any other boarding establishment.

In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a boarding establishment for animals by any person at any premises, a local authority shall in particular pay regard to the following:

# that cats will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects construction, size of quarters, number of occupants, exercising facilities, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness
# that cats will be adequately supplied with suitable food, drink and bedding material, adequately exercised / stimulated, and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals
# that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent and control the spread among cats of infectious or contagious diseases, including the provision of adequate isolation facilities
# that appropriate steps will be taken for the protection of the cats in case of fire or other emergency
# that a register - either hard or soft copy - be kept, containing a description of any cats received into the establishment, date of arrival and departure, and the name and address of the owner; such register is to be available for inspection at all times by an officer of the local authority, vet or veterinary practitioner authorised by the local authority.

International Cat Care (ICC), a long-established cat charity in the United Kingdom, has defined standards for the construction and management of boarding catteries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starting a boarding cattery|url=http://icatcare.org/advice/catteries/starting-boarding-cattery|website=International Cat Care|publisher=International Cat Care|accessdate=8 October 2015}}</ref>  ICC standards are in addition to those set by local councils for licensing purposes.

== Breeding cattery ==
A breeding cattery is where cats are [[Animal husbandry|bred]]. Cats may be bred as a hobby, or on a commercial basis where they are sold for profit.

In the United States, there are two main cat registries - the [[Cat Fanciers Association]]  (CFA) and [[The International Cat Association]] (TICA) which establish standards for member breeders. These cat registries also award certificates for catteries that have been inspected for healthy environments.  Additionally, many U.S. States and municipalities, along with the Federal government, provide some regulations of breeding catteries.

In Europe the standards are established by the [[Fédération Internationale Féline]] (FIFe) or [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF). In Italy by the [[Associazione Nazionale Felina Italiana]] (ANFI).

The '''KattenKabinet''' (""Cat Cabinet"") is an art museum in [[Amsterdam]] devoted to works depicting [[cat]]s. The museum collection includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works of art by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Guillaume Cornelis van Beverloo|Corneille]], [[Sal Meijer]], [[Théophile Steinlen]], and [[Jože Ciuha]], among others.

The museum is housed in a canalside building at [[Herengracht]] 497, in the grand ''[[Gouden Bocht]]'' (""Golden Bend"") of this canal. The owner lives on the second floor of the building with his family. There are some cats in the museum as well.

== History == 
The house and the adjacent building at Herengracht 499 were built in 1667 for the patrician brothers Willem and Adriaen van Loon. Through the luck of the draw, Willem was given the house at number 497. Later, the house was inhabited by Amsterdam mayor [[Jan Calkoen]] and Amsterdam pensionary [[Engelbert François van Berckel]], among others. [[John Adams]] visited Van Berckel at the house during his time as U.S. ambassador to the Dutch republic.

In 1985, the building was restored, and in 1990 the museum was founded by Bob Meijer in memory of his red tomcat John Pierpont Morgan (named after the American banker [[J. P. Morgan]]).

The museum served as filming location for ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ocean Twelve - Production notes - About the production|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=2807|publisher=CinemaReview.com|accessdate=December 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Description==
The phobia manifests itself in different ways. For most people it is less about fear than about loathing, similar to the reaction many people have to snakes or rats. Some people  experience it almost all the time, others just in response to direct stimuli. Some possible situations that can trigger the loathing of cats are: hearing purring, seeing a cat in real life, imagining the possibility of a cat touching or rubbing against one, the thought of meeting a cat in the dark, seeing the staring eyes of a cat (cats have the tendency to stare at passers-by) cats in pictures and on television, and cat-like toys and cat-like fur. [[Big cats]] such as [[lions]] or [[tigers]] can also trigger the stimuli associated with a phobia.<ref name=freeman1960>{{Cite journal|first=H. L. |last=Freeman |author2=D. C.

==Treatment==
There are many ways to treat ailurophobia; treatment is usually carried out by a psychiatrist or other therapy specialist.

One strongly motivated patient was able to recover by slowly becoming accustomed to cat fur by first touching varying types of velvet, then becoming accustomed to a toy kitten, and finally a live kitten which the patient subsequently adopted.<ref name=freeman1960/>

== In popular culture ==
In the 1965 animated television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]],'' the character [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] lists a number of phobias to [[Charlie Brown]] and incorrectly states, ""If you’re afraid of cats, you have ailurophasia.""<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ashleyriver.ccsdschools.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_2888189/File/Staff%20Documents/K.%20W.%20Brown/A_Charlie_Brown_Christmas.pdf|title=A Charlie Brown Christmas|last=Schulz|first=Charles|date=|website=Ashley River Creative Arts Elementary School|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-18}}</ref>

In the 1988 anime ''[[City Hunter|City Hunter 2]]'', despite his herculean physique, it was revealed that Umibozu has a fear of cats.

In the 1989 anime ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'' the character principal [[Ranma Saotome]] has fear of cats.

In the 2017 anime ''[[Nyanko Days]],'' the character Arashi Iketani has a fear of cats.

The title character in ''[[Big Nate]]'' suffers from this.

'''Toe tufts''' are commonly found on [[cat]]s with medium to long coats. Clumps of fur that stick out at least 1–2&nbsp;cm beyond the paw pad can be considered tufts. In addition to soft [[paw]] pads, toe tufts help a cat to silently stalk its prey by muffling excess noise. However, outdoor cats tend to lose their toe tufts due to excessive abrasion on the rougher outdoor surfaces.  This is in distinct contrast to indoor cats who spend most of their time walking on carpet or smooth floors.

Although toe tufts do not cause additional [[hairball]]s in cats, it does make some aspects of hygiene a bit more difficult. For example, cat litter, dirt and other particulates may stick to toe tufts and cause the cat some discomfort. Therefore, a cat with extra long toe tufts should be checked regularly for tangles and taken in for [[Personal grooming|grooming]].

'''Deaf white cats''' are domestic cats with a pure white coat.  Some all-white cats suffer from [[congenital deafness]] caused by a degeneration of the [[inner ear]].<ref name=Bosher>[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/162/987/147.abstract Observations on the Histological Features, Development and Pathogenesis of the Inner Ear Degeneration of the Deaf White Cat]</ref> This condition can occur in cats with yellow, green and blue irises, although the chances of deafness are dramatically increased with blue irises.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask Elizabeth:  White Cats and Blindness/Deafness|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/health_information/deaf.cfm|website=Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|publisher=Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine Ithaca, New York|accessdate=3 December 2016}}</ref> In white cats with mixed-coloured eyes ([[odd-eyed cats]]), it has been found that deafness is more likely to affect the ear on the blue-eyed side.<ref name=Bosher /> White cats can have blue, gold, green, or copper coloured odd eyes.

In one 1997 study of white cats with varying degrees of hearing deficiency, 72% of the animals{{Please clarify|reason=Does ""varying degrees"" include zero?|date=September 2016}} were found to be totally deaf. The entire [[organ of Corti]] was found to have degenerated within the first few weeks after birth; however, even during these weeks no brain stem responses could be evoked by auditory stimuli, suggesting that these animals had never experienced any auditory sensations. It was found that some months after the organ of Corti had degenerated, the [[spiral ganglion]]  also began to degenerate.<ref name=Heid>[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378595597001822 A model for prelingual deafness, the congenitally deaf white cat –population statistics and degenerative changes]</ref>

==Genetics==

The gene that causes a cat to have a white coat is a dominant masking gene. As a result, the cat will have an underlying coat colour and pattern. When the dominant white gene is present, however, that pattern will not be expressed. A cat that is homozygous (WW) or heterozygous (Ww) for this gene will have a white coat despite the underlying pattern/colour. A cat that lacks this dominant masking gene (ww) will exhibit a coat colour/pattern. There are several sources for a white cat to have blue eyes. If the underlying coat pattern is one of a pointed cat (also referred to as a Siamese pattern), the blue eyes may come from the genetics of the pointed gene. A common misconception is that all white cats with blue eyes are deaf.<ref>{{cite book|author=George M. Strain|title=Deafness in Dogs and Cats|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=clmDR0wFtKkC|year=2011|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-764-5|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=clmDR0wFtKkC&pg=PA68 68]}}</ref> It is possible to have a cat with a naturally white coat without this gene, as an extreme form of [[white spotting]], although this is rare – some small non-white patch usually remains.

'''Cat training''' is the process of modifying a domestic [[cat]]'s behavior for entertainment or companionship purposes. Training is commonly used to reduce unwanted or problematic behaviors in domestic cats, to enhance interactions between humans and pet cats, and to allow them to coexist comfortably. There are various methods for training cats which employ different balances between reward and punishment.

==House training==

===Litter box training===

Cats may be easily trained to use a [[kitty litter]] box or tray, as this is natural behavior. Many cats and kittens will instinctively use a litter box without needing to be taught, because of their instincts to expel bodily waste in dirt or sand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Litter Box Training for Your Kitten|url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+2137&aid=3288|website=Peteducation.com}}</ref> Therefore, with a new kitten, owners usually need to simply show the kitten where the litter box is located, and how to get in and out. On occasion, some training is required to help a new cat adjust to a litter box, or to help an older cat that suddenly stops using the litter box.

Cats may also be trained to use a human [[toilet]].<ref name=UTYC4>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC&printsec=frontcover#PPA52,M1|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H. Ellen Whiteley|year=2006|isbn=978-0-86534-509-6|chapter=ch.4 Etiquette Training}}</ref> The benefits of this method are that cat owners can eliminate the task of maintaining a clean litter box on a regular basis and avoid the smell that results when a litter box is not cleaned often enough. Some cat behaviorists advise against toilet training because it restricts the owner from monitoring changes in the cat's urine and feces (which are often related to the health of the pet). Another criticism is that toilet training can cause various stresses to the cat, partly because using the toilet goes against a cat's natural instinct to dig and cover its own feces, and because the toilet seat can be physically difficult for cats to straddle (especially those who are old or ill).<ref name=Toilet-CBA>{{cite web|title=Is Toilet Training Your Cat a Good Idea?|url=http://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/toilet-training/|website=Catbehaviorassociates.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

==Training methods==

===Positive reinforcement===

Cats are known for their [[independence]] and self-interest. They will resist training by [[punishment]], reacting with [[fear]] and stress rather than [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. <ref name=Training-ASPCA/> The result of failure to instill obedience may be that the human unintentionally reinforces undesired behavior, like loud meowing or complaining for attention.<ref name=UTYC>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H. Ellen Whiteley|year=2006|isbn=978-0-86534-509-6|pages=1–8}}</ref> Therefore most trainers encourage cat owners to use [[positive reinforcement]] training only, rewarding the cat for desired or ""good"" behavior, and offering her alternative options or distractions (instead of punishment) for undesired behavior. <ref name=Training-ASPCA/> Training a cat involves motivation, cooperation, time, and patience from the human.<ref name=Righetti/>

===Clicker training===

[[Clicker training]] was developed by Keller Breland, Marian Breland Bailey, and Bob Bailey.<ref name=KarenPryor>{{cite web|last1=Pryor|first1=Karen|title=Clicker Training: A Grass Roots Revolution in Behavioral Technology|url=http://www.clickertraining.com/node/153|website=Clickertraining.com|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> The technique was initially used in the training of marine mammals, and later spread into the world of pet training (mainly dogs and cats, but it has been used with other animals as well). Clicker training uses a sound to signal to the animal that he/she has performed the correct, or desired, behavior.<ref name=Clicker-ASPCA>{{cite web|title=Clicker Training Your Pet|url=http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/clicker-training-your-pet|website=ASPCA.org|accessdate=2015}}</ref> Trainers can utilize any item that makes a sound (e.g., a whistle, a beep, or a pen that clicks). Many people use a training tool called a [[clicker]], a little plastic box with a metal tab that, when pressed quickly, makes the click sound.<ref name=Clicker-ASPCA/> When clicker training a cat, the trainer clicks at the exact moment that the cat does the desired behavior and rewards with a treat immediately after the click. The cat will begin to associate the sound with the treat, and understand that the sound means she has done the right thing. Clicker training is popular in the cat training field because the clicker (or other sound) allows a trainer to tell the cat immediately when she has performed correctly, and makes it easier for the cat to identify exactly which action/behavior she is being rewarded for.<ref name=Training-ASPCA>{{cite web|title=Training Your Cat|url=https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/cat-behavior/training-your-cat|website=ASPCA.org|accessdate=2015}}</ref>

==Problem behaviors==
A veterinarian can rule out possible medical causes for behavioral issues in cats.<ref name=Schelling>{{cite web|last1=Schelling|first1=Christianne|title=Training your cat|url=http://www.cattraining.com/cat-train-basics.htm|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> If medical causes are ruled out, cat behaviorists can help address problematic behaviors by retraining the cat and humans so that the cat's needs are met.<ref>[http://kluv.cbslocal.com/2014/05/20/jackson-galaxy-the-show-sould-be-called-my-people-from-hell/ ""Jackson Galaxy: The Show Should Be Called 'My People From Hell'""], 98.7 KLUV, May 20, 2014.</ref>

===Scratching===

Many cats scratch furniture like chairs and couches (even when scratching posts are provided for them in the home) because a cat's instinct is to scratch various objects, like trees, as a marker for other cats to see and smell.<ref name=Yin-scratching></ref> Trainers suggest guiding cats toward designated scratching objects that they will enjoy, changing the style or location of scratching posts around the house, and making scratching the furniture inconvenient.<ref name=Yin-scratching>{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=June is Adopt a Cat Month: Training Your New Cat to Stop Scratching Furniture|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/june-is-adopt-a-cat-month-training-your-new-cat-not-to-scratch-furniture|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref> Some use positive reinforcement training, often accompanied by a clicker, to engage the cat in using the scratching post.

===Spraying===

[[Urine spraying]] is a problem usually found with intact male cats, but can also occur with females and [[neutering|neutered]] cats. Solutions for this issue include: keeping the litter box extremely clean, removing causes of stress from the cat's environment, providing separate food and litter boxes in a multiple cat household, and preventing outdoor cats from accessing the yard and area around the house. In cases where spraying persists, owners are recommended to seek veterinary help as this could be due to anxiety or physical health issues.<ref name=Yin-spraying>{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=Tips for Dealing with Urine Spraying in Cats|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/tips-for-dealing-with-urine-spraying-in-cats|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

===Meowing===

Cats [[cat communication|meow]] for various reasons, and some are naturally more vocal than others. This becomes a problem behavior when there is excessive meowing or yowling, especially at night. Positive reinforcement training, sometimes accompanied by a clicker, is commonly used in this case. This involves ignoring the cat when she is making noise, and rewarding with treats and affection when she is being quiet.<ref name=Yin-meowing>{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Sophia|title=Training a Cat to Be Quiet: My Cat Meows Too Much, What Do I Do?|url=http://drsophiayin.com/blog/entry/training-a-cat-to-be-quiet-my-cat-meows-too-much-what-do-i-do|website=drsophiayin.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref>

==Tricks==
A cat may be trained to do tricks such as playing dead or ringing the doorbell.<ref name=UTYC7>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iut5j1Yf0IC&printsec=frontcover#PPA120,M1|title=Understanding and Training Your Cat Or Kitten|author=H.

[[File:Ryo-ohki.jpg|thumb|The cabbit [[Ryo-Ohki]] from the [[Tenchi Muyo]] anime series]]
A '''cabbit''' is a fictional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] between a [[cat]] and a [[rabbit]].  They have appeared in fiction and fantasy stories including [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] and [[manga]], and have also been dubiously purported to have been observed in the wild.  Most if not all observations are attributable to either misidentified [[Manx cat]]s or outright hoaxes.

A cat-rabbit hybrid creature was first incorrectly documented by [[Joseph Train]] of Castle Douglas, Galloway, Scotland, in his ""An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man"", where he opined that the local Manx cat was such a hybrid: ""My observations on the structure and habits of the specimen in my possession, leave little doubt on my mind of its being a ''mule'', or cross between the female cat and the buck rabbit.""<ref name=""Train"">{{Harvnb|Train|1845}}, volume 1, p.21n; By ''mule'', Train means only figuratively of course, he's not suggesting the manx is a cross between horse and ass</ref> Train also refers to the tufty tail on the posterior of the ""Manks"" cat as being a ''fud'' ({{lang-sco|[[wiktionary:fud#Scots|fud]]}}), ""or brush like that of a rabbit."" Scientific study has determined that such a hybrid is genetically impossible.<ref name=""cantbreed"">Sarah Hartwell.  [http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit3.htm ""Cabbits - Why Cats Can't Breed With Rabbits""].  2005.</ref>

The [[portmanteau]] term ""cabbit"" is used for such imagined hybrids.  The exact year of coinage is uncertain.  The term was used in 1977 to describe a specimen found in New Mexico and exhibited in Los Angeles.  The specimen was showcased on the [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]] and was later determined to be a cat with a deformed pelvis.<ref name=""messybeast"">[http://www.messybeast.com/cabbit.htm Cabbits - What Are They]</ref>

==Cat mutations==
[[Manx cat]]s and other cats with tailless or bobtailed mutations account for many alleged cabbit sightings.  The mutation that causes taillessness can also cause skeletal and/or nerve abnormalities that result in the cat's using a hopping motion.  This was once accepted by breeders as a feature of the Manx's look, but is now considered a serious fault in the show-ring and does not form part of the modern Manx standard of points.  Modern breeders of the Manx are careful to breed only from cats that have normal locomotion.  The relatively long hind legs of the Manx, combined with taillessness or a very short tail, give the impression of a rabbit.

In 1947, Grace Cox-Ife wrote: ""There are several points about a Manx that make it anything but ordinary. The chief one is, of course, its taillessness; but this is not quite the whole story. Not only must a Manx have no tail but it should really be a further joint or more short on the spinal column; that is to say there should be a hollow where the tail would normally begin. Then there is the gait &ndash; a rabbity hop rather than a walk- which is caused by the height of the hindquarters: according to the Manx Cat Club these ""cannot be too high, and the back cannot be too short, while there must be great depth of flank. The head should be round and large, but not of the snubby or Persian type.<ref name=""Cox-Ife"">{{cite book| last=Cox-Ife |first=Grace |title=Questions Answered About Cats |year=1948 |publisher=Jordan & Sons |location=London, England}}</ref>

Occasionally the flap of loose skin from the belly to the haunches is absent, enhancing the visual similarity to a rabbit.

Cats with radial [[hypoplasia]] (abnormal short forelegs) may also adopt a rabbit-like gait.

A '''cat lady''' is a cultural archetype or a [[stock character]], often depicted as a single woman, a middle-aged or elderly [[spinster]], who owns many pet [[cat]]s. The term can be considered [[pejorative]],<ref name=""Forbes"">{{citation |url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/10/14/crazy-cat-lady-pets-stereotype-forbes-woman-time-felines.html |title= Crazy Cat Ladies |author=Kiri Blakeley |date=15 Oct 2009 |work=Forbes}}</ref> though it is sometimes embraced.<ref name=""timesunion.com"">{{citation |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/mydogbandit/do-you-believe-in-the-crazy-cat-lady/2080/ |title= Do you believe in the Crazy Cat Lady? |author=Mark Ramirez |date=5 Aug 2009 |work=timesunion.com}}</ref> 

== Usage and association ==
Women who have cats have long been associated with the concept of [[spinster]]hood. In more recent decades, the concept of a cat lady has been associated with ""romance-challenged (often career-oriented) women"".<ref name=Forbes/>

A cat lady may also be an [[Animal hoarding|animal hoarder]] who keeps large numbers of cats without having the ability to properly house or care for them.<ref>{{Citation| last = Davis| first = Susan| author-link = | last2 = Flaherty (illus)| first2 = Jake| author2-link = | title = Prosecuting Animal Hoarders is like Herding Cats| journal = California Lawyer| volume = | issue = September| pages = 26, 28, 29, 67| date = | year = 2002| url = http://www.tufts.edu/vet/hoarding/pubs/herdingcats.pdf| accessdate = June 26, 2011 }}</ref> They may be ignorant about their situation, or generally unaware of their situation.

The '''cultural depiction of cats''' and their relationship to humans is as old as civilization and stretches back over 9,500 years. [[Cat]]s have figured in the history of many nations, are the subject of legend and are a favorite subject of artists and writers.

== Earliest history ==
{{One source section|date=April 2016}}

Cats were originally domesticated because they hunted [[Mouse|mice]] that would eat stored grains, protecting the food stores. It was a beneficial situation for both species: cats got a reliable source of prey, and humans got effortless pest control. This mutually beneficial arrangement began the relationship between cats and humans which continues to this day.

While the exact history of human interaction with cats is still somewhat vague, a shallow grave site discovered in 1983 in [[Cyprus]], dating to 7500 BCE, during the [[Neolithic]] period, contains the skeleton of a human, buried ceremonially with stone tools, a lump of iron oxide, and a handful of seashells. In its own tiny grave 40 centimeters (18&nbsp;inches) from the human grave was an eight-month-old cat, its body oriented in the same westward direction as the human skeleton. Cats are not native to Cyprus. This is evidence that cats were being tamed just as humankind was establishing the first settlements in the part of the Middle East known as the [[Fertile Crescent]].<ref>{{cite journal |work=Scientific American |date=June 2009 |author=Carlos A. Driscoll, Juliet Clutton-Brock |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taming-of-the-cat&print=true |title=The Evolution of House Cats; Genetic and archaeological findings hint that wildcats became house cats earlier--and in a different place--than previously thought|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

== Ancient Egypt ==
{{main article|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
Cats, known in [[ancient Egypt]] as the ''mau'', played a large role in ancient Egyptian society. They were associated with the goddesses [[Isis]] and [[Bastet|Ba'at]].<ref name=Cirlot62>{{cite book|author=Cirlot JE|title=A Dictionary of Symbols|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|year=1967|origyear=1962|page=38}}</ref> Cats were very commonly depicted in art and routinely mummified.

==China==

[[File:Mao I 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Cats in the Garden'', by Mao Yi, 12th century]]

Cats that were favored pets during the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] were long-haired cats for catching rats, and cats with yellow-and-white fur called 'lion-cats', who were valued simply as cute pets.<ref name=""gernet 48"">Gernet, 48.</ref><ref name=""gernet 122 123"">Gernet, 122&ndash;123.</ref> Cats could be pampered with items bought from the market such as ""cat-nests"", and were often fed fish that were advertised in the market specifically for cats.<ref name=""gernet 48""/><ref name=""gernet 122 123""/>

==Europe==

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Freyja]] was associated with cats. Farmers sought protection for their crops by leaving pans of milk in their fields for Freya's special feline companions, the two grey cats who fought with her and pulled her chariot.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cat in Magic and Myth |last= Howey |first=M.

[[Folklore]] dating back to as early as 1607 tells that a cat will suffocate a newborn infant by  putting its nose to the child's mouth, sucking the breath out of the infant.<ref name=""deVries76""/>

[[Black cat]]s are generally held to be unlucky in the United States and Europe, and to portend good luck in the United Kingdom.<ref name=""deVries76""/> In the latter country, a black cat entering a house or ship is a good omen, and a sailor's wife should have a black cat for her husband's safety on the sea.<ref name=""deVries76""/><ref>Eyers, Jonathan (2011). ''Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions''. A&C Black, London, UK. {{ISBN|978-1-4081-3131-2}}.</ref> Elsewhere, it is unlucky if a black cat crosses one's path; black cats have been associated with death and darkness.<ref name=Cirlot62/> White cats, bearing the colour of ghosts, are conversely held to be unlucky in the United Kingdom, while tortoiseshell cats are lucky.<ref name=""deVries76""/> It is common lore that cats have nine lives.<ref name=""deVries76""/> It is a tribute to their perceived durability, their occasional apparent lack of instinct for self-preservation, and their seeming ability to survive falls that would be fatal to other animals.

Cats were seen as good luck charms by actors, and the cats often helped cure the actors' stage fright.<ref name=100cats/>

===Classical folklore===
The Greek essayist [[Plutarch]] linked cats with cleanliness, noting that unnatural odours could make them mad.<ref>Plutarch: Adv. on Marr. 44</ref> Pliny linked them with lust,<ref>Pliny 10, 83</ref> and [[Aesop]] with deviousness and cunning.<ref name=""deVries76"">{{cite book |last=de Vries |first=Ad |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |pages=85–86|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=0-7204-8021-3}}</ref>

===Middle Ages===
Cats were associated with witches, and were killed ''en masse'' in the middle of the 14th century during the time of the [[Black Death]]. Had this bias toward cats not existed, local rodent populations could have been kept down, lessening the spread of plague-infected fleas from host to host.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/genetics/2008-06-09-science-of-cats_N.htm Feline geneticist traces origin of the cat]</ref>

Vikings used cats as rat catchers and companions.

A medieval King of Wales, [[Hywel Dda]] (the Good) passed legislation making it illegal to kill or harm a cat.<ref>[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/31lawsofhyweldda.html Taking Liberties - Star Items - Laws of Hywel Dda]</ref>

In Medieval [[Ypres]], cats were used in the winter months to control the vermin infesting the wool stored in the upper floors of the [[Cloth Hall, Ypres|Cloth Hall]] (Lakenhall). At the start of the spring warm-up, after the wool had been sold, the cats were thrown out of the [[bell tower|belfry]] tower to the town square below, which supposedly symbolised ""the killing of evil academics"". In today's [[Kattenstoet]] (Cat Parade), this was commuted to the throwing of woolen cats from the top of out houses and also the people from the Middle Ages used to often suck on the wool as a sign of good luck.

===Renaissance and Victorian depictions===
In the [[Renaissance]], cats were often thought to be [[witch]]es' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s (for example, Greymalkin, the first witch's familiar in ''[[Macbeth]]'''s famous opening scene), and during festivities were sometimes [[cat-burning|burnt alive]] or thrown off tall buildings. Cats became popular and sympathetic characters in such [[folklore|folk tale]] as ''[[Puss in Boots]]''.<ref name=purr>Roberts, Patrick. [http://www.purr-n-fur.org.uk/fabled/whittington.html ""Dick Whittington and his Cat: The myth and the reality""], Fabled Felines, purr-n-fur.org (2008)</ref>

[[Image:Richard Wittington and his Cat.jpg|left|thumb|''Richard Whittington and his Cat'' (1808)]]
One English folk tale in which a cat is given a heroic role is ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'', which has been adapted for many stage works, including plays, [[musical theatre|musical comedies]] and [[pantomime]]s. It tells of a poor boy in the 14th century, based on the real-life [[Richard Whittington]], who becomes a wealthy merchant and eventually the [[Lord Mayor of London]] because of the ratting abilities of his cat. There is no historical evidence that Whittington had a cat,<ref name=purr/> In the tale, Dick Whittington, a poor orphan finds work at the great house of Mr. Fitzwarren, a rich merchant. His little room infested with rats, Dick acquires a cat, who drives off the rats. One day, Mr. Fitzwarren asked his servants if they wished to send something in his ship, leaving on a journey to a far off port, to trade for gold. Reluctantly, Dick sent his cat. In the far-off court, Dick's cat had become a hero by driving very troublesome vermin from the royal court. When Fitzwarren's ship returned, it was loaded with riches. Dick was a rich man. He joined Mr. Fitzwarren in his business and married his daughter Alice, and in time became the Lord Mayor of London.<ref>Cruikshank, George.

==Japan==
[[File:Maneki neko Germersheim 2.jpg|200px|thumb|A typical Maneki Neko.]]

{{One source section|date=April 2016}}

In [[Japan]], there is also the saying called the [[Maneki-neko|Maneki Neko]], also referred to in English as the ""good fortune"" or ""good luck"" cat. It is usually a sitting cat with paw raised and bent. Legend in Japan has it that a cat waved a paw at a Japanese landlord, who was intrigued by this gesture and went towards it. A few seconds later a lightning bolt struck where the landlord had been previously standing. The landlord attributed his good fortune to the cat's fortuitous action. A symbol of good luck hence, it is most often seen in businesses to draw in money. In Japan, the flapping of the hand is a ""come here"" gesture, so the cat is beckoning customers.

There is also a small cat shrine ({{nihongo|'''neko jinja'''|猫神社}}) built in the middle of the [[Tashirojima|Tashirojima island]]. In the past, the islanders raised silkworms for silk, and cats were kept in order to keep the mouse population down (because mice are a natural predator of silkworms). Fixed-net fishing was popular on the island after the Edo Period and fishermen from other areas would come and stay on the island overnight. The cats would go to the inns where the fishermen were staying and beg for scraps. Over time, the fishermen developed a fondness for the cats and would observe the cats closely, interpreting their actions as predictions of the weather and fish patterns. One day, when the fishermen were collecting rocks to use with the fixed-nets, a stray rock fell and killed one of the cats. The fishermen, feeling sorry for the loss of the cat, buried it and enshrined it at this location on the island.

Another Japanese legend of cats is the [[nekomata]]: when a cat lives to a certain age, it grows another tail and can stand up and speak in a human language.

==Russia==
[[File:KotKazansky.jpg|thumb|Eighteenth century folk art, ''Cat of Kazan'']]
{{One source section|date=April 2016}}

Cats have been considered good luck in Russia for centuries. Owning a cat, and especially letting one into a new house before the humans move in, is said to bring good fortune.<ref>[http://www.moscowcatmuseum.com/eng/06.html Moscow Cat Museum]</ref>

[[Hermitage cats|Many cats have guarded]] the [[Hermitage Museum]]/[[Winter Palace]] continually, since [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]]'s reign, when she was presented by the city of [[Kazan]] in [[Tatarstan]] five of their best mousers to control the palace's rodent problem.<ref>[http://www.russianlife.com/article.cfm?Number=1733 Russian Life]</ref> They lived pampered lives and even had special servants until the [[October Revolution]], after which they were cared for by volunteers. Now, they are again looked after by employees.

==Africa==

{{One source section|date=April 2016}}

Cats are considered a delicacy by the West African [[Ewe people]], who believe that eating cat meat, particularly the head, brings good luck to the eater and would prevent them from dying in a foreign land. In [[Ghana]], cats are often associated with witchcraft and evil. Thus, seeing a black cat in one's dream is considered a bad omen.

==Modern culture==
[[File:Grumpy_Cat_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Pictures of [[Grumpy Cat]] are frequently found in the form of memes, due to Grumpy Cat's deformed features giving a permanently unhappy appearance.]]
{{One source section|date=April 2016}}

Cats have also featured prominently in modern culture. For example, a cat named Mimsey was used by [[MTM Enterprises]] as their mascot and features in their logo as a spoof of the [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|MGM lion]].<ref name=""100cats"">{{cite book|last=Stall|first=Sam|title=100 Cats Who Changed Civilization: History's Most Influential Felines|isbn=978-1-59474-163-0|publisher=Quirk Books|year=2007}}</ref> {{asof|1990}} cats were the most popular subject depicted on gift items, such as coasters, napkins, jewelry, and bookends. An estimated 1,000 stores in the United States sold nothing but cat-related items.<ref name=""dickinson19900722"">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/22/business/all-about-cat-supplies-billions-for-food-and-knicknacks-to-boot.html?pagewanted=all | title=All About/Cat Supplies; Billions for Food, And Knicknacks to Boot | work=The New York Times | date=1990-07-22 | accessdate=March 8, 2013 | author=Dickinson, Ernest}}</ref>

On the Internet, [[The Internet and cats|cats frequently appear]] often as [[meme]]s and other humor; and on social media people frequently post pictures of their own cats.

Instead of disturbing the cat he cut off the sleeve and let him sleep.
* A similar legend states that when [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] was born, he would not stop crying no matter what anyone did, and what finally calmed him was when a tabby cat jumped into the manger, and its purring lulled him to sleep. The [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] petted the cat in gratitude, and the ""M"" on the forehead of the [[tabby cat]] is for her name.

A '''kitten''', also known as a '''kitty''' or '''kitty cat''', is a [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] [[cat]]. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.

==Etymology and development==
The word ""kitten"" derives from the [[Middle English]] word ''kitoun'', which in turn came from the [[Old French]] ''chitoun'' or ''cheton''.{{sfn|Oxford Dictionary 2005}} Juvenile [[big cat]]s are called ""cubs"" rather than kittens; either term may be used for the young of smaller wild [[felidae|felids]], such as [[ocelot]]s, [[caracal]]s and [[lynx]], but ""kitten"" is usually more common for these species.{{sfn|Sunquist|Sunquist|2014|pp=58–59}}

[[File:Laitche-P013.jpg|thumb|left|A litter of kittens being suckled by their mother]]
[[File:Youngkitten.JPG|thumb|left|A kitten opens its eyes for the first time]]
[[File:Aggressive Mother Cat.jpg|thumb|left|A mother cat protecting her kittens at [[Chinawal]], India]]
A feline [[Litter (animal)|litter]] usually consists of two to five kittens{{sfn|Tsutsui|Stabenfeldt|1993|p=1699}} born after a [[gestation]] lasting between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days.{{sfn|Tsutsui|Stabenfeldt|1993|p=1699}} Kittens emerge in a sac called the [[amnion]], which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.{{sfn|Vandivert|1975|p=53}}

For the first several weeks, kittens are unable to [[urinate]] or [[defecate]] without being stimulated by their mother.{{sfn|Pet Education 2011}} They are also unable to regulate their body temperature for the first three weeks, so kittens born in temperatures less than {{convert|27|C|F}} can die from [[hypothermia]] if their mother does not keep them warm.{{sfn|International Cat Care 2015}} The mother's milk is very important for the kittens' nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers [[antibody|antibodies]] to the kittens, which helps protect them against [[infectious disease]].{{sfn|Casal|Jezyk|Giger|1996|p=1653}} Newborn kittens are unable to produce concentrated [[urine]], and so have a very high requirement for fluids.{{sfn|Sturgess|Hurley|2005|p=243}} Kittens open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth. At first, the [[retina]] is poorly developed and vision is poor. Kittens are not able to see as well as adult cats until about ten weeks after birth.{{sfn|Tootle|Friedlander|1989|p=1325}}

Kittens develop very quickly from about two weeks of age until their seventh week. Their coordination and strength improve. They [[play (activity)|play]]-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the adult cats demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate.{{sfn|Poirier|Hussey|1982|pp=133–148}} As they reach three to four weeks old, the kittens are gradually [[weaning|weaned]] and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks.{{sfn|Sturgess|Hurley|2005|p=244}} Kittens generally begin to lose their [[deciduous teeth|baby teeth]] around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months.{{sfn|Veterinary Medicine 2013}} Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others continue to look after them until they approach [[sexual maturity]].{{sfn|Bönisch|1996|pp=23–24}}

The sex of kittens is usually easy to determine at birth. By six to eight weeks they are harder to sex because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male's [[urinary meatus|urethral opening]] is round, whereas the female's urethral opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between [[anus]] and urethral opening, which is greater in males than in females.{{sfn|Walls|1991|p=22}}

Kittens are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with available animals and playing on their own. Play with other kittens peaks in the third or fourth month after birth, with more solitary hunting and stalking play peaking later, at about five months.{{sfn|Crowell-Davis|2005|p=18}} 

Kittens are vulnerable because they like to find dark places to hide, sometimes with fatal results if they are not watched carefully.<ref>Cats have a habit of seeking refuge under or inside cars or on top of car tires during stormy or cold weather. This often leads to broken bones, burns, heat stroke, damaged internal organs or death. Daphne Sashin, [http://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/risky-hiding-places-for-cats Five Risky Hiding Places For Cats]. WebMD, September 14, 2010.</ref> 

Although domestic kittens are commonly sent to new homes at six to eight weeks of age, it has been suggested that being with their mother and litter-mates from six to twelve weeks is important for a kitten's social and behavioural development.{{sfn|Crowell-Davis|2005|p=18}} Usually, breeders and foster/rescue homes will not sell or adopt out a kitten that is younger than twelve weeks. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to give away kittens younger than eight weeks of age.{{sfn|Sunquist|Sunquist|2014|p=111}} Kittens generally reach sexual maturity at around seven months old. A cat reaches full ""adulthood"" around one year of age.{{sfn|Santa Maria Times 2013}}

==Health==
Domestic kittens in developed societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses from two to three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against [[feline viral rhinotracheitis]] (FVR), [[feline calicivirus]] (C), and [[feline panleukopenia]] (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against [[rabies]] may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually [[spaying and neutering|spayed or neutered]] at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in [[animal shelter]]s.{{sfn|Olson|Kustritz|Johnston|2001|pp=223–232}} Such early neutering does not appear to have any [[Spaying and neutering#Disadvantages|long-term health risks to cats]], and may even be beneficial in male cats.{{sfn|Spain|Scarlett|Houpt|2004|pp=372–379}} Kittens are commonly wormed against [[roundworm]]s from about four weeks.{{sfn|McHattie|1993|p=121}}

==Orphaned kittens==
[[File:Black Cat Nala.jpg|thumb|right||A young orphaned [[black cat|black kitten]] in [[Los Angeles]], showing signs of [[malnourishment]]]]
Kittens require a high-calorie diet that contains more protein than the diet of adult cats.{{sfn|Rogers|Morris|1979|pp=718–723}} Young orphaned kittens require cat milk every two to four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate.{{sfn|Pet Education 2011}} Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because [[Dairy cattle|cow]]'s milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients.{{sfn|Guilford|1994|pp=2663–2669}} Human-reared kittens tend to be very affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression.{{sfn|Heath|2005|p=102}} Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.{{sfn|Messonnier|2010|p=375}}

In this form of entertainment, people would gather dozens of [[cat]]s in a net and hoist them high into the air from a special bundle onto a [[bonfire]].

[[James Frazer]] wrote: ""It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.""<ref>[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]]. ''The Golden Bough'', (1922). [http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html Online version.]</ref>

Cat-burning was also described in [[The Great Cat Massacre]], a scholarly work by American historian [[Robert Darnton]]:
<blockquote>Cats also figured in the cycle of Saint John the Baptist, which took place on June 24, at the time of summer solstice. Crowds made bonfires, jumped over them, danced around them, and threw into them objects with magical power, hoping to avoid disaster and obtain good fortune during the rest of the year. A favorite object was cats&nbsp;— cats tied up in bags, cats suspended from ropes, or cats burned at stake. Parisians liked to incinerate cats by the sackful, while the Courimauds (or ""cour à miaud"" or cat chasers) of Saint Chamond preferred to chase a flaming cat through the streets. In parts of Burgundy and Lorraine they danced around a kind of burning May pole with a cat tied to it. In the Metz region they burned a dozen cats at a time in a basket on top of a bonfire. The ceremony took place with great pomp in Metz itself, until it was abolished in 1765. ...&nbsp;Although the practice varied from place to place, the ingredients were everywhere the same: a ""feu de joie"" (bonfire), cats, and an aura of hilarious witch-hunting. Wherever the scent of burning felines could be found, a smile was sure to follow.<ref name=""Cat Massacre"">{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|location=|isbn=0-465-01274-4|pages=83–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-taE3FLTlMC&pg=PA83&dq=cat+burning&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fEqQT4TBIa-p0AGNnqmwBQ&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=cat%20burning&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Jean Meslier]], a French Catholic priest who privately held atheist views, briefly mentioned the practice of cat burning in his ''Testament'' as follows:
<blockquote>Among other things, these mischievous, brutal madmen make [the cats] cruelly suffer harsh and violent tortures in their entertainments and even in public celebrations; they tie up nipping cats to the end of some pole they set up and at the bottom of which they light the fires of joy where they burn them alive to have the pleasure of seeing the violent movements and hearing the frightening cries that these poor unfortunate beasts are forced to make because of the harshness and violence of the tortures.<ref name=""Meslier"">{{cite book|last=Meslier|first=Jean|title=Testament: Memoir of the thoughts and sentiments of Jean Meslier|year=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-59102-749-2|pages=562–563}}</ref></blockquote>

Meslier largely attributed these customs to [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosophy]], wherein non-human animals were viewed as possessing no soul, and thus, no sentience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kemerling|first=Garth|title=Descartes: A New Approach|url=http://www.wisdomworld.org/additional/ExtensionsOfEvidence-Series/DescartesAndTheSoul.html|work=Philosophy Pages|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> He posited that this ""tends to stifle in the heart of man all feelings of gentleness, kindness, and compassion that they may have for beasts&nbsp;...""<ref name=""Meslier"" />

Hundreds of millions of [[cat]]s are kept as [[pet]]s around the world. Cats have either a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] relationship with humans. Cats are also used in the fur trade, as food, and to control pests.

Cats and humans evolutionarily diverged from a common ancestor ([[boreoeutherian ancestor]]) approximately 80 million years ago, accumulating only 10–12 [[chromosomal translocation]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Anatoly Ruvinsky |author2=Jennifer A.

== Domesticated varieties ==
The current [[list of cat breeds]] is quite large: with the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] recognizing 41 breeds, of which 16 are ""natural breeds"" that probably emerged before humans began breeding pedigree cats, while the others were developed over the latter half of the 20th century.<ref name=Lipinski>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.10.009 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=12–21 |title=The ascent of cat breeds: Genetic evaluations of breeds and worldwide random-bred populations |journal=Genomics |date=January 2008 |pmid=18060738 |pmc=2267438 |last1=Lipinski |first1=Monika J. |last2=Froenicke |first2=Lutz |last3=Baysac |first3=Kathleen C. |last4=Billings |first4=Nicholas C. |last5=Leutenegger |first5=Christian M. |last6=Levy |first6=Alon M. |last7=Longeri |first7=Maria |last8=Niini |first8=Tirri |last9=Ozpinar |first9=Haydar 
}}</ref> Because of common crossbreeding, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the homogeneous breeds of [[domestic long-haired cat|domestic longhair]] and [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic shorthair]], depending on their type of fur.

=== Cat coat patterns and colors ===
These are discussed at [[Cat coat genetics#Cat coat patterns and colors|Cat coat genetics]].

=== Body types ===
Cats can also come in several body types, ranging between two extremes:

; Oriental: Not a specific breed, but any cat with an elongated slender build, almond-shaped eyes, long nose, large ears (the Siamese and [[Oriental Shorthair]] breeds are examples of this).
; Foreign: Less slender than the oriental type, but nevertheless a cat with a slight build and generally athletic look. Typical example breeds would be the [[Abyssinian (cat)|Abyssinian cat]] and the [[Turkish Angora]]. 
; Semi-Foreign: More or less the middle range of body conformation types, this type of cat is less slender without being stocky. Example breeds would be the [[Devon Rex]] and the [[Egyptian Mau]].
; Semi-Cobby: These cats look more rounded without looking too stocky. Example breeds would be the [[American Shorthair]] and [[British Shorthair]].
; Cobby: Any cat with a short, muscular, compact build, roundish eyes, short nose, and small ears. [[Persian cat]]s and [[Exotic Shorthair|Exotic cat]]s are two prime examples of such a body type.

== Effects on human health ==
Because of their small size, domesticated house cats pose little physical danger to adult humans. However, in the USA cats inflict about 400,000 bites per year. This number represents about one in ten of all animal bites.<ref name=Kravetz/> Many cat bites will become infected,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Talan DA, Citron DM, Abrahamian FM, Moran GJ, Goldstein EJ |title=Bacteriologic analysis of infected dog and cat bites.

From another point of view, cats are thought to be able to improve the general [[Mood (psychology)|mood]] of their owners by alleviating negative attitudes. According to a Swiss study carried out in 2003, cats may change the overall psychological state of their owner as their company's effect appears to be comparable to that of a human partner.<ref name=""Turner 2003"">{{Cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Dennis C. |last2=Rieger |first2=G. |last3=Gygax |first3=L. |url= http://en.scientificcommons.org/20081280 |title=Abstract: 'Spouses and Cats and Their Effects on Human Mood' |journal=ScientificCommons.org |publisher=magazine.One UG |location=Berlin |year=2003 |accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref> The researchers concluded that, while cats were not shown to promote positive moods, they do alleviate negative ones.

One study found that cat ownership is associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes at the 95% confidence interval.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Qureshi |first1=A.

Several studies have shown that cats develop affection towards their owners. However, the effect of these pets on human health is closely related to the time and effort the cat owner is able to invest in it, in terms of bonding and playing.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Beneficial Effects of Pet Ownership on Some Aspects of Human Health and Behaviour |date=3 October 2011 |pmc=1295517 |volume=84 |issue=12 |pmid=1774745 |last=Serpell |first=J. |pages=717–720 |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}</ref>

== Indoor scratching ==
A natural behavior in cats is to hook their front claws periodically into suitable surfaces and pull backwards. Cats, like humans, keep their muscles trim and their body flexible by stretching.  Additionally, such periodic scratching serves to clean and sharpen their claws.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Landsberg GM |title=Feline scratching and destruction and the effects of declawing |journal=Vet. Clin. North Am. Small Anim. Pract. |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=265–79 |year=1991 |pmid=2053250}}</ref>  Indoor cats may benefit from being provided with a [[scratching post]] so that they are less likely to use carpet or furniture, which they can easily ruin.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAB Information Sheet: Scratching or Clawing in the House |url= http://www.fabcats.org/behaviour/scratching/info.html |date=February 2008 |work=FABCats.org |publisher=Feline Advisory Bureau |location=Tisbury, England |accessdate=14 August 2005}}</ref> However, some cats may simply ignore such a device. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery. Using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher texture of the carpet backing, may be a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Scratching posts made of [[sisal]] rope or [[corrugated fiberboard|corrugated cardboard]] are also common.

[[File:Cat claw closeup.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a cat's claw.]]
Although scratching can serve cats to keep their claws from growing excessively long, their nails can be trimmed if necessary. Another response to indoor scratching is [[onychectomy]], commonly known as declawing. This is a surgical procedure to remove the claw and first bone of each digit of a cat's paws. Declawing is most commonly only performed on the front feet.

== Waste ==
Being fastidious self-cleaners, cats detest their own waste and instinctually bury their urine and feces. Indoor cats are usually provided with a box containing [[Litter box|litter]], generally consisting of [[bentonite]], but sometimes other absorbent material such as shredded paper or wood chips, or sometimes [[sand]] or similar material can be used. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes [[constipation|constipated]] and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favor of another location.

Daily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat's health. Bentonite or clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid=8888544 |year=1996 |last1=Hornfeldt |first1=CS |last2=Westfall |title=Suspected bentonite toxicosis in a cat from ingestion of clay cat litter |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=365–6 |journal=Veterinary and human toxicology}}</ref>

[[File:Toilet Trained Cat 22 Aug 2005.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A toilet-trained house cat]]
Some cats can be trained to use the human toilet, eliminating the litter box and its attendant expense, [[Odor|unpleasant odor]], and the need to use landfill space for disposal.

An exhibit at the [[San Diego Natural History Museum]] states that cat feces from [[urban runoff]] carry [[Toxoplasma gondii]] parasites to the ocean and kill [[sea otter]]s.<ref>http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu/RESEARCH/PROJPROF_PDF/Conrad_CZ169.pdf</ref>

22072677,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cat_Drop,"{{one source|date=September 2014}}
'''Operation Cat Drop''' is the name commonly given to an account, of uncertain veracity, about the delivery, by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Air Force]], of cats to a remote village in [[Sarawak]], [[Borneo]]. The cats were delivered in crates, dropped by parachute, as part of a broader program of supplying cats to combat a plague of rats. The cat population had previously been reduced as an unintended consequence of spraying [[DDT]] for [[malaria]] control. The story, often with various elaborations is often told as an illustration of the problems that may arise from well-intended interventions in the environment, or of [[unintended consequences]] more generally.

It is not clear whether the events of the Operation Cat Drop story actually transpired as the story is commonly told or if the cats were ever delivered by parachute. While cats are indeed unusually susceptible to the toxic effects of DDT, and cat die-offs were a not unheard of side effect of malaria control operations, many aspects of the story have been called into question. For example, it was probably [[dieldrin]] rather than DDT which was used for malaria control in the region and caused numerous cat deaths.<ref name=""pmid18799776"">{{cite journal |author=O'Shaughnessy PT |title=Parachuting cats and crushed eggs the controversy over the use of DDT to control malaria |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=98 |issue=11 |pages=1940–8 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18799776 |pmc=2636426 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.122523 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=18799776}}</ref>

A '''[[Feral animal|feral]] cat''' is a [[cat]] that has been born to other ferals or from stray cats as opposed to domesticated cats.  These ferals are unaccustomed to human interaction.<ref name="":10"">{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/feral_cats/qa/feral_cat_FAQs.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/|title=Outdoor Cats: Frequently Asked Questions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[The Humane Society of the United States]]|access-date=12 September 2016}}</ref>

This article discusses the definition, history, behavior, health, distribution and habitat, control and management, and effects on wildlife.  Further subtopics incehaviors and characteristics of both farm cats and ship's cats and how they relate to feral cats.

==Definition==
Feral is an adjective defined as existing in a wild state, not domesticated. It can also be used to describe a quality of wild animals as ferocious or brutal. The meaning of the term ''feral cat'' varies between professions and countries, and is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms such as ''free-roaming'', ''street'', ''alley,'' or ''community cat''. Feral can also mean reverting to the wild state from domestication therefore, some of these terms are also used to refer to stray cats, although stray and feral cats are generally considered to be different by [[Animal rescue group|rescuers]], [[Veterinary physician|veterinarians]], and researchers.<ref name=""definition"" /> Stray cats are socialized cats who no longer live in homes, but could potentially be successfully reintroduced to a home environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alleycat.org/StrayorFeral|title=Feral and Stray Cats—An Important Difference|publisher=Alley Cat Allies|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery]]'' found that rescuers and veterinarians in the [[United Kingdom]] tended to distinguish feral cats from domesticated cats based on traits such as their levels of socialization, ownership, and confinement, and on the amount of fear of, interaction with, and dependence upon humans. They found that rescuers and veterinarians tended to agree that feral cats were cats that had not had much human contact (particularly before eight weeks of age), would try to avoid humans, and would prefer to escape rather than attack a human. However, veterinarians and rescuers disagreed on whether a feral cat would tend to hiss and spit at or attack a human during an encounter, and disagreed on whether adult ferals could potentially be [[Tame animal|tamed]]. The article provided a composite definition of a feral cat as a cat that would choose not to interact with humans, could survive with or without human assistance, and would hide or defend itself when trapped rather than allowing itself to be handled.<ref name=""definition"">{{cite journal |last1 = Gosling|first1 = Lara|last2 = Stavisky|first2 = Jenny|last3 = Dean|first3 = Rachel|year = 2013|title = What is a feral cat?: Variation in definitions may be associated with different management strategies.|journal = Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|quote = PROPOSED DEFINITION: A feral cat is proposed by this study to be a cat that is unapproachable in its free-roaming environment and is capable of surviving with or without direct human intervention, and may additionally show fearful or defensive behaviour on human contact.|doi = 10.1177/1098612X13481034|pmid = 23966002|pages = 759–64|issue = 9|volume = 15}}</ref>

A survey of rescuers and veterinarians in the [[United States]] found that there was no widely accepted definition of a feral cat. Many facilities used waiting periods to evaluate whether a cat was feral by observing whether the cat became less afraid and evasive over time. Other indicators included the cat's response to touch with an inanimate object, and observation of social behavior from the cat in varying environments (in response to human contact, with a human nearby, or when moved to a quieter environment).<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal|last=Slater|first=Margaret R.|last2=Miller|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Weiss|first3=Emily|last4=Makolinski|first4=Kathleen V.|last5=Weisbrot|first5=Lila A.

=== Farm cat ===
{{main article|Farm cat}}
[[File:Feral cat Virginia crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Feral farm cat]]
[[Farm cat]]s (also called barn cats) are cats that live on agricultural properties in [[feral]] or [[semi-feral]] condition. They primarily live outdoors, usually sheltering in outbuildings. They hunt [[vermin]] such as rodents and other small animals that live in or around outbuildings and farm fields.

The need to keep rodents from consuming or contaminating grain crops stored for later human consumption may be the original reason cats were domesticated.<ref name=""Pedersen 1991"" /> They are still commonly kept for the purpose of catching undesired vermin found on [[farm]]s and [[ranch]]es, which would otherwise eat or contaminate [[crops]], especially [[cereal|grain]] or [[fodder|feed]] stocks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.coloradoan.com/story/life/2016/02/05/geller-care-keeping-importance-barn-cats/78414844/|title=Geller: The care, keeping and importance of barn cats|last=Geller|first=Jon|date=5 February 2016|work=[[Fort Collins Coloradoan|Coloradoan]]|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref>

===Ship's cat===
{{main article|Ship's cat}}

[[Ship's cat]]s are typically feral or semi-feral, and were once common features on many trading, exploration, and naval ships. Cats were primarily brought aboard to catch mice and rats, which can cause damage to ropes, woodwork, and eventually as technology progressed, electrical wiring. Rodents also presented a threat to the stores the ship carried, both as cargo and as food for sailors. Rats and mice were also sources of [[disease]], which was dangerous for ships at sea for long periods of time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/cats-and-the-sea-services|title=Cats in the Sea Services|website=U.S. Naval Institute|access-date=9 March 2016}}</ref> Cats have been officially banned from some commercial and military fleets, though they are sometimes still kept privately by sailors.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=How domestic cats spread|encyclopedia=The Cat Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|location=New York, NY|date=16 June 2014|page=19|isbn=9781465419590}}</ref>

==History==
Although scientists do not agree on whether cats were originally domesticated in [[Egypt]] or if they were introduced there after domestication, the spread of cats throughout much of the world is thought to have originated in Egypt, where they were popular and effective at controlling [[mouse]] populations. Traders from [[Phoenicia]] brought them to Europe to control [[rat]] populations, and monks brought them further into Asia. Roman armies also helped with the spread, eventually bringing them to [[England]].<ref name=""Pedersen 1991"">{{Cite encyclopedia|title = History of domestic cats and cat breeds|date = 1991|encyclopedia = Feline Husbandry: Diseases and Management in the Multiple Cat Environment|publisher = American Veterinary Publications, Inc.|editor-last = Pedersen|editor-first = Niels C.|location = Goleta, CA|last = Wastlhuber|first = Joan|isbn = 978-0939674299}}</ref> Since then, cats continued to be introduced to new areas, often by sailors or settlers. Cats are thought to have been introduced to Australia in either the 1600s by Dutch shipwrecks, or the late 1700s by English settlers.<ref name=""dsewpc"" /><ref name="":0"" /> These domesticated cats began to form feral populations after their offspring began living away from human contact.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite report|title = Overview of the Impacts of Feral Cats on Australian Native Fauna|last = Dickman|first = Chris R.|date = May 1996|url = http://secure.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/impacts-feral-cats.pdf|publisher = Australian Nature Conversation Agency and University of Sydney}}</ref>

==Behavior==
Some behaviors are commonly observed among feral cats, although there is disagreement among veterinarians, rescuers, and researchers on the prevalence of some. In a free-roaming environment, feral cats avoid humans. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and back away or run when they are able to do so. If trapped, they may hiss, growl, bare their teeth, or strike out.<ref name="":4"">{{Cite book|title=Cat Culture: The Social World of A Cat Shelter|last=Alger|first=Janet M.|last2=Alger|first2=Steven F.|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4399-0772-6|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=}}</ref> They remain fairly hidden from humans and will not approach, although some feral cats gradually become more comfortable around humans who feed them regularly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/feral_cats/qa/feral_cat_FAQs.html|title=Outdoor Cats: Frequently Asked Questions|date=8 January 2015|website=The Humane Society of the United States|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Colonies ===
[[File:Herd of Cats.jpg|thumb|A colony of feral cats]]
Feral cats often live in ''colonies'', groups of feral cats that live together in one territory, often near food sources and shelter.<ref name="":3"" /> Researchers disagree on the existence, extent, and structure of [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]] within feral colonies.<ref name="":4"" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crowell-Davis|first=Sharon L.|last2=Curtis|first2=Terry M.|last3=Knowles|first3=Rebecca J.|date=1 February 2004|title=Social organization in the cat: A modern understanding|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=6|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1016/j.jfms.2003.09.013|issn=1098-612X|pmid=15123163}}</ref> Different types of hierarchies have been observed in feral colonies, including [[Despotism|despotic]] and linear hierarchies. Some colonies are organized in more complex structures, such as relative hierarchies, where social status of individual cats can vary on their location, the time of day, or the activity the cats are engaged in (particularly feeding and mating).<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social Behavior of Domestic Cats|last = Voith|first = Victoria L.|date = September 1986|journal = Compendium on Continuing Education for the Practising Veterinarian|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Borchelt|first2 = Peter L.|volume = 8|issue = 9|pages = 637–646}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bonanni|first=Roberto|last2=Cafazzo|first2=Simona|last3=Fantini|first3=Claudio|last4=Pontier|first4=Dominique|last5=Natoli|first5=Eugenia|date=2007-11-01|title=Feeding-order in an urban feral domestic cat colony: relationship to dominance rank, sex and age|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1369–1379|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.02.029}}</ref>

When a human decides to care for a feral colony, it is often called a ''managed colony.'' The care given can include regularly supplying food and water to the cats, providing shelters, helping with [[trap-neuter-return]] programs, providing continued veterinary care, finding foster homes for cats that can be socialized for eventual adoption, and working to educate people who live in the neighborhood.<ref name="":3"" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/getting-started/the-7-steps-of-tnr|title=The 7 Steps of TNR|last=|first=|date=|website=Neighborhood Cats|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102033110/http://www.neighborhoodcats.org/how-to-tnr/getting-started/the-7-steps-of-tnr|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=dmy}}</ref>

In a 2013 study of participants from the United Kingdom, rescuers tended to be more willing than veterinarians to attempt to tame adult feral cats. Veterinarians tended to be more opposed to this practice, with some expressing concerns for the welfare of such a cat in a home environment.<ref name=""definition"" /> In a 2010 study of veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for adult cats.<ref name="":5"" />

A long-term study of a [[trap-neuter-return]] (TNR) program on a university campus in Central Florida found that, despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, 83% of the cats studied had been present for more than six years, with almost half first observed as adults of unknown age.

=== Disease prevalence ===
Feral cats, as with all cats, are susceptible to diseases and infections including [[rabies]], [[bartonellosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]], [[Parasitism|parasites]], [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV), [[feline leukemia virus]] (FeLV), [[Rickettsia|rickettsial diseases]], and [[feline respiratory disease complex]] (FRDC, a group of respiratory illnesses including [[Feline viral rhinotracheitis|feline herpesvirus type 1]], [[feline calicivirus]], ''[[Chlamydia felis]]'', and ''[[Mycoplasma felis]]'').<ref name="":7"">{{Cite journal|last=Roebling|first=A.

Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus belong to the [[Retrovirus|''Retroviridae'']] family, and both cause [[immunosuppression]] in cats, which can increase their susceptibility to other infections. Research has shown that the prevalence of these viruses among feral cat populations is low and is similar to prevalence rates for owned cats in the United States.<ref name=""lee"">{{cite journal|pmid=12418520|year=2002|author1=Lee|first1=I.

Researchers studying 553 feral cats in Northern [[Florida]] in the United States tested them for a number of infections that could be detrimental to feline or human health. The study found the most prevalent infection to be ''[[Bartonella henselae]]'', the cause of [[cat-scratch disease]] in humans, with 33.6% of the cats testing positive. [[Feline coronavirus]] was the next most common infection, found in 18.3% of the cats, although they noted that the antibody levels were low in most of the cats who tested positive, and concluded that the cats they tested did not appear to be a greater risk for [[Viral shedding|shedding]] the virus than pet cats.<ref name="":6"" /> Researchers studying 96 feral cats on [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada found that [[Toxocara cati|feline roundworm]] was the most common infection in cats in that colony, afflicting 34% of cats. This was followed by ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', which was detected in 29.8% of cats, although only one cat of the 78 for whom fecal samples were available was shedding ''T. gondii'' [[Apicomplexan life cycle|oocysts]]. They did note that most fecal samples collected indicated the presence of one [[intestinal parasite]], with some samples indicating the presence of multiple parasites.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal|last=Stojanovic|first=Vladimir|last2=Foley|first2=Peter|date=2011-09-01|title=Infectious disease prevalence in a feral cat population on Prince Edward Island, Canada|journal=The Canadian Veterinary Journal|volume=52|issue=9|pages=979–982|issn=0008-5286|pmc=3157072|pmid=22379197}}</ref>

==== Transmission to humans ====

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] has warned about the rabies risk associated with feral cats. With 16% of people infected with rabies from exposure to rabid cats, cats have been the primary animals responsible for transmission of the virus to humans in the United States since the efforts to control rabies in dogs in the 1970s.<ref name="":8"">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/17/feral-cats-colonies-rabies-risk/2665359/|title=Feral cat colonies could pose rabies risk, CDC says|last=Weise|first=Elizabeth Weise|date=18 August 2013|website=USA TODAY|access-date=10 March 2016}}</ref> In 2010, there were 303 rabid cats reported within the United States.<ref name="":7"" /> Although some colony management programs involve administering [[rabies vaccine]]s, the need to revaccinate every few years makes this challenging to maintain.<ref name="":8""/> Furthermore, lack of documentation can mean that contact with vaccinated feral cats may still require [[Post-exposure prophylaxis|post-exposure]] treatment.<ref name="":7"" />

The study of feral cats on Prince Edward Island warned of ""considerable [[Zoonosis|zoonotic]] risk"" for transmission of intestinal parasites. Although the authors noted that their study did not provide evidence for great risk associated with ''T. gondii'' in cats, they advised that the risk should still be considered, as the infection in humans can cause significant health problems, and cats who are not otherwise transmitting the infection can begin shedding the virus in times of stress.<ref name="":2"" />

Cats are found on many remote islands, such as the [[Hawaiian Islands]], where they are an invasive species. Based on [[microsatellite]] genetic tests it was determined that these cats have a mainly European ancestry. These cats’ globetrotting ways can be attributed to Humans’ ship trading routes in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Katrin|last2=Algar|first2=Dave|last3=Schwenk|first3=Klaus|date=2016-08-01|title=Feral Cat Globetrotters: genetic traces of historical human-mediated dispersal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2261/abstract|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=6|issue=15|pages=5321–5332|doi=10.1002/ece3.2261|issn=2045-7758|pmc=4984506|pmid=27551385}}</ref>[[File:Ganymede Cat.jpeg|thumb|Feral cat father (right) with his kitten (left).

Most feral cats have small [[home range]]s, although some are more transient and travel long distances. The home ranges of male feral cats, which are generally two or three times larger than those of female cats, are on average under {{Convert|10|ha|lk=on}}, but can vary from almost {{Convert|300|ha}} to under {{Convert|1|ha}}. This variance is often due to breeding season, access to females, whether the cat is neutered, age, time of day, and availability of prey.<ref name="":9"">{{Cite journal|last=Lepczyk|first=Christopher A.|last2=Lohr|first2=Cheryl A.|last3=Duffy|first3=David C.|title=A review of cat behavior in relation to disease risk and management options|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=173|pages=29–39|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.07.002|year=2015}}</ref>

In 2011, an Australian study emphasised the need to monitor the effects of culling programs after [[infrared camera]]s found that the culling of feral cats led to an increase in feral cat populations in the culled areas. It was thought that only dominant cats were being baited and trapped during such operations. After the removal of dominant cats, there was an influx of subordinate animals to the area which unlike the dominant cats, did not venture into the traps. Within a year cat numbers in culled areas stabilised to original numbers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2015/04/07/4203004.htm|title=Culling cats 'may do more harm than good'|last=Salleh|first=Anna|date=7 April 2015|website=ABC|language=en-AU|access-date=4 September 2016}}</ref>

==Effects on wildlife==
{{main article|Cat predation on wildlife}}
Cats hunt small prey, such as rodents and birds. Free-ranging cats kill one to four billion birds and six to 22 billion mammals annually in the forty eight contiguous states of the United States.  Feral cats kill the majority of birds.  They are the largest source of human caused killing of birds.<ref name=""NATURE.COMMUNICATIONS.1396"">{{cite report |last1=Loss|first1=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.|date=2012-09-06|title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/full/ncomms2380.html|publisher=NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |section=Article number: 1396 |edition=Nature Communications 4, |access-date=2016-08-20 |quote=Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States.

Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals.}}</ref>

Sometimes feral cats kill non-native pests. Feral cats have been intentionally introduced to some areas as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] control strategy. In the 1800s, thousands of cats were introduced near settlements in Australia that had developed near [[Gold mining|gold dig]] sites and farms as an attempt to manage populations of mice, rabbits, and rats.<ref name="":0"" />

Feral cats have interbred with [[wildcat]]s to various extents throughout the world, the first reported case occurring more than 200 years ago. The significance of hybridisation is disputed.

[[File:Monstruo - Weimar Meneses (7253622860).jpg|thumb|alt=a long-haired kitten|The word ''pussy'' refers to cats, weakness or cowardice, or female genitalia, in addition to other meanings.]]
The word '''pussy''' is a [[noun]], an [[adjective]], and in rare uses a [[verb]] in the [[English language]]. It has several meanings, including use as [[slang]], as [[euphemism]], and as [[vulgarity]]. Common [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of the noun include ""[[cat]]"", as well as ""[[cowardice|coward]] or [[weakness|weakling]]"", and ""the human [[vulva]] or [[vagina]]"", or as a [[synecdoche]], ""[[sexual intercourse]] with a woman"".<ref name=""OED 1"" /> Because of its multiple senses including both innocent and vulgar [[connotation]]s, ""pussy"" is often the subject of [[double entendre]].

The [[etymology]] of the word is not entirely clear. Several different senses of the word have different histories or origins.<ref name=""OED 1"">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussy, ''n''. and ''adj''.<sup>2</sup> |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref><ref name=""OED 2"">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussy, ''adj''.<sup>1</sup> |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref><ref name=""OED 3"">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussy, ''adj''.<sup>3</sup> |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The noun ''pussy'' meaning ""cat"" comes from the [[Modern English]] word ''puss'', a conventional name or term of address for a pet cat.<ref name=""OED puss"">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =puss, ''n''.<sup>1</sup> |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) says that [[cognate]]s are common to several [[Germanic language]]s, including [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''poes'' and [[Middle Low German]] ''pūse'', which are also used to call a cat. The word ''puss'' is attested in English as early as 1533. Earlier etymology is uncertain, but similar words exist in other European languages, including [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puisín'', both traditional calls to attract a cat.<ref name=""OED puss""/>

The words ''puss'' and derived forms ''pussy'' and ''pusscat'' were extended to refer to girls or women by the seventeenth century.<ref name=""OED 1"" /><ref name=""OED puss""/> This sense of ''pussy'' was used to refer specifically to genitalia by the eighteenth century, and from there further extended to refer to sexual intercourse involving a woman by the twentieth century.<ref name=""OED 1"" />

[[Noah Webster]], in his original 1828 ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', defined ''pussy'' as: ""inflated, swelled; hence, fat, short and thick; and as persons of this make labor in respiration, the word is used for short breathed"". He gave ''pursy'' as a ""corrupt orthography"" or misspelling of ''pussy''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster |first=Noah |title=An American Dictionary of the English Language |year=1828 |location=New York |publisher=S. Converse |oclc=468942038}}</ref> In 1913, however, ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' reversed the original, suggesting that ''pussy'' was a ""colloquial or low"" variant of ''pursy''. That word, in turn, was defined as ""fat and short-breathed"", with etymology from [[Old French]] ''pousser'' ""to push"".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Webster |first1=Noah |last2=Porter |first2=Noah |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1913 |location=Springfield, MA |publisher=G. & C. Merriam |oclc=504785161 |pages=1166–1167}}</ref>

The ''Webster's Third International Dictionary'' points out similarities between ''pussy'' in the sense of ""vulva"" and Low German or Scandinavian words meaning ""pocket"" or ""purse"", including [[Old Norse]] ''pūss'' and [[Old English]] ''pusa''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gove |first=Phillip |title=Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged |year=1961 |location=Springfield, MA |publisher=G. & C. Merriam |isbn=978-0-8777-9302-1}}</ref>

The medieval [[French language|French]] word ''pucelle'', meaning ""maiden"" or ""virgin"", is not related to the English word. It is attested in Old French from the ninth century, and likely derives from [[Latin]]. The precise Latin source is disputed, with either ''puella'' ""girl"" or ''pulla'' ""[[pullet]], young female chicken"" suggested as earlier sources.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pucelle, ''n''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref>

As a [[homograph]], ''pussy'' also has the meaning ""containing [[pus]]"";<ref name=""OED 3"" /> with this meaning, the word is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʌ|s|ɪ}}, while the other forms are all pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ʊ|s|ɪ}}. Another adjective is the rare or obsolete [[Northern England English|Northern English]] dialect form ''pursy'' meaning ""fat"" or ""short-winded"".<ref name=""OED 2"" /> 

Meanings of the verb relate to the common noun senses, including ""to act like a cat"", ""to act like a coward"", or ""to have sex with a woman"".<ref name=""OED verb"">{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussy, ''v''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref> <!-- Add modern slang senses: man (especially prisoner) used unwillingly for another man's sexual gratification; submissive subordinate or underling. --> Adjective meanings are related to the noun.

== Uses ==

=== Cat and similar ===
[[File:Salix caprea 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male [[catkin]]s from a [[Salix caprea|pussy willow]]]]
Both in English and in [[German language|German]] ''puss'' was used as a ""call-name"" for cats, but in English ''pussy'' was used as a synonym for the word ''cat'' in other uses as well. In addition to cats, the word was also used for [[rabbit]]s and [[hare]]s as well as a humorous name for [[tiger]]s. In the 19th century,  the meaning was extended to anything soft and furry. ''[[Pussy willow]]'', for example, is a name applied to various species in the genus ''[[Salix]]'' with furry [[catkin]]s. In [[thieves' cant]] the word ''pussy'' means a ""fur coat"".<ref name=""OED 1"" />

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' gives as the first meaning of the noun: ""Chiefly colloq[uial]. A girl or woman exhibiting characteristics associated with a cat, esp[ecially] sweetness or amiability. Freq[uently] used as a pet name or as a term of endearment."" The examples it cites from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries are not sexual. Another example, not cited by the OED, is one of the main characters of [[E. Nesbit]]'s ''[[Five Children and It]]'' - Jane, nicknamed Pussy by her siblings.

The verb ''pussyfoot'', meaning to walk softly or to speak in an evasive or cautious manner, may come from the adjective ''pussy-footed'' ""having a cat-like foot"", or directly from the noun ''pussyfoot''. This word, first attested in the late nineteenth century, is related to both the ""cat"" and the ""woman"" meanings of ''pussy''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =pussyfoot, ''v''. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=third |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}</ref>

=== Female genitalia ===

[[File:Pussyhat Project hat.jpg|right|thumb|Woman wearing a ""pussyhat""|108x108px]]
In contemporary English, use of the word ''pussy'' to refer to women is considered derogatory or demeaning, treating people as sexual objects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=James |first=Deborah |title=Gender-linked derogatory terms and their use by women and men |journal=American Speech |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=399–420 |year=1998 |doi=10.2307/455584}}</ref> As a reference to genitals or to sexual intercourse, the word is considered vulgar slang. Studies find the word used more commonly in conversations among men than in groups of women or mixed-gender groups, though subjects report using ''pussy'' more often than other slang terms for female genitals.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Simkins |first1=Lawrence |last2=Rinck |first2=Christine |title=Male and female sexual vocabulary in different interpersonal contexts |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=160–172 |year=1982 |doi=10.1080/00224498209551146}}</ref> 

[[Donald Trump]]'s use of the word to describe his interactions with women (""grab them by the pussy"", known as the [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording|Billy Bush recording]]) provoked strong reactions by media figures and politicians across the political spectrum; an image of a snarling cat with the slogan ""pussy grabs back"" became a ""rallying cry for female rage against Trump"".<ref>Nicole Puglise, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/10/donald-trump-pussy-grabs-back-meme-women-twitter 'Pussy grabs back' becomes rallying cry for female rage against Trump], ''The Guardian'' (October 10, 2016).</ref> Pink ""pussyhats"" (knitted caps with cat-like ears) were a notable feature of [[2017 Women's March|the worldwide protests]] held the day after Trump's inauguration as President of the United States. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Kurtzleben|first1=Danielle|title=With 'Pussyhats,' Liberals Get Their Own Version Of The Red Trucker Hat|url=http://www.npr.org/2017/01/21/510997192/with-pussyhats-liberals-get-their-own-version-of-the-red-trucker-hat|accessdate=January 22, 2017|work=NPR.org|date=January 21, 2017}}</ref>

Words referring to cats are used as vulgar slang for female genitals in some other European languages as well. Examples include German ''Muschi'' (literally ""house cat""),<ref>{{cite book|editor1=O. Thyen |editor2=M. Clark |editor3=W. Scholze-Stubenrecht |editor4=J.B. Sykes |title=The Oxford-Duden German Dictionary|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860248-4}}</ref> French ''chatte'' (""female cat"", also used to refer to sexual intercourse),<ref name=""Robert"">{{cite book|last=Rey|first=Alain|title=Le Nouveau Petit Robert Dictionnaire De La Langue Francais|year=2000|isbn=978-2-85036-668-0|language=French}}</ref> and Dutch ''poes'' (""puss"").<ref name=""OED puss"" /> The Portuguese term ''rata'' (literally ""female rat"")<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Maria F.|title=The Routledge Portuguese Bilingual Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-99725-9}}</ref> and Norwegian ''mus'' (""mouse"")<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirkeby |first=Willy |year=1989 |title=English–Norwegian Dictionary |location=Bergen |publisher=Norwegian University Press |isbn=978-8200182931}}</ref> are also animal terms used as vulgar slang for women's genitals.

=== Weakness ===
{{see also|Gender role}}
The word ''pussy'' is also used in a derogatory sense to mean cowardly, weak, or easily fatigued. The ''Collins Dictionary'' says: {{nowrap|""(}}taboo, slang, mainly US) an ineffectual or timid person.""<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pussies online]</ref> It may refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine, as in: ""The coach calls us pussies.""<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jim McKay|author2=Michael A. Messner|author3=Donald Sabo|title=Masculinities, Gender Relations, and Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Osehn3at7GoC&pg=PA39|year=2000|publisher=SAGE |page=39}}</ref>

Men who are dominated by women (particularly by their partners or spouses and at one time referred to as 'hen-pecked', see [[pecking order]]) can be referred to as ''pussy-whipped'' (or simply ''whipped'' in slightly more polite society or media).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} This may be used simply to denigrate a man who is contented in a relationship. The hyphenated phrase is parsed as ""whipped by pussy"" – a manipulative relationship dynamic wherein a female deliberately or subconsciously [[sex strike|withholds sexual intercourse]] to coerce the male into surrendering power in other aspects of the relationship. The male's weakness is his desire for access to female genitalia, and his willingness to weaken his position in the relationship to obtain that access, combining two uses of the word pussy.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Word-play between meanings ==
[[File:BarrisonPussy.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Barrison Sisters]] lift their dresses to show a live kitten, a double entendre of ""pussy"".]]
'''Pussy''' is one of a large number of English words that has both erotic and non-erotic meanings. Such [[double entendre]] has long been used in the creation of sexual humor.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lefcourt |first1=Herbert |last2=Sordoni |first2=Carl |last3=Sordoni |first3=Carol |title=Locus of control and the expression of humor |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=130–143 |year=1974 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.ep8969660}}</ref> The double entendre has been used for over a hundred years by performers, including the late-19th-century [[vaudeville]] act the [[Barrison Sisters]], who performed the notorious routine ""Do You Want To See My Pussy?"" in which they raised their skirts to reveal live kittens.<ref>{{cite book|last=Silverton|first=Peter|title=Filthy English: The How, Why, When And What Of Everyday Swearing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xSErq0ssG74C&pg=PT182|year=2011|publisher=Granta Publications|isbn=978-1-84627-452-7|page=182}}</ref>

In the British comedy ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' the character [[Mrs. Slocombe]] often expressed concern for the welfare of her pussy. The double entendre made every reference to her cat seem to be a salacious and therefore humorous reference to her vagina.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosewarne|first=Lauren|title=American Taboo: The Forbidden Words, Unspoken Rules, and Secret Morality of Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XWijAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39934-3|pages=81–82}}</ref>

In the 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' a rapper insults his rivals by including the line, ""How can six dicks be pussies?"" The line relies on double meanings of both [[Dick (slang)|''dick'']] (either ""contemptible person"" or ""male genitalia"") and ''pussy'' (""weak"" or ""female genitalia""). Such [[word play]] presents a challenge for translators of the film.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taivalkoski-Shilov |first=Kristiina |title=Subtitling ''8 Mile'' in three languages: Translation problems and translator licence |journal=Target: International Journal of Translation Studies |year=2008 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=248–274 |doi=10.1075/target.20.2.04tai}}</ref>

[[Pussy Riot]] is a Russian radical [[feminist]] punk-rock collective that stages illegal events in [[Moscow]] protesting the President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the status of women in Russian society. Band member ""Kot"" says that she knows how the word is used in English, and that it is also used in Russian as term of endearment for little girls.

Cats have highly specialized [[tooth|teeth]] for the killing of prey and the tearing of meat. The ''[[premolar]]'' and ''[[Molar (tooth)|first molar]]'', together the ''[[carnassial]] pair'' are located on each side of the mouth. These teeth efficiently function to shear meat like a pair of scissors. While this is present in [[Canidae|canids]], it is highly developed in felines.

The cat's [[tongue]] has sharp spines, or ''[[Filiform papilla|papillae]]'', useful for retaining and ripping flesh from a carcass. These papillae are small backward-facing hooks that contain [[keratin]] which also assist in their [[Personal grooming|grooming]].

The cat's oral structures provide for a variety of vocalizations used for [[cat communication|communication]], including meowing, purring, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking, and grunting.

Because of this mobility, a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in another direction. Most cats have straight ears pointing upward. Unlike [[dog]]s, flap-eared breeds are extremely rare (''[[Scottish Fold]]s'' are one such exceptional [[mutation]]). When angry or frightened, a cat will lay back its ears to accompany the growling or hissing sounds it makes. Cats also turn their ears back when they are playing or to listen to a sound coming from behind them. The fold of skin forming a pouch on the lower posterior part of the ear, known as [[Henry's pocket]], is usually prominent in a cat's ear.<ref name=""consultations"">{{cite book | last = August| first = John| authorlink = | title = Consultations in Feline Internal Medicine, Volume 6 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | year = 2009 | location = | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> It is of unknown function, though it may assist in filtering sounds.

==Nose==
[[File:Detalhe nariz Osk.jpg|thumb|upright|A cat's nose is highly adapted]]
Cats are highly territorial and secreting odors plays a major role in cat communication. The nose helps cats to identify territories, other cats and mates, to locate food, and for various other causes.<ref name=About.com>{{cite web|last=Syufy F.|title=The Nose Knows Cats' Amazing Sense of Scent|url=http://cats.about.com/cs/felineanatomy/a/catsnose_scent.htm|work=About.com}}</ref> A cat's sense of smell is believed to be about fourteen times stronger than that of humans. The [[rhinarium]] (the leathery bit of nose we see) is quite tough to allow it to absorb rather rough treatment sometimes. The color varies according to the [[genotype]] (genetic makeup) of the cat. Cat's skin has the same color as the fur but the color of the nose leather is probably dictated by a dedicated gene. Cats with white fur have skin susceptible to damage by [[ultraviolet light]] that may cause cancer. Extra care is required when outside in hot sun.<ref>{{cite web|work=cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org|title=Cat Anatomy|url=http://cat-chitchat.pictures-of-cats.org/2008/07/cat-anatomy.html|date=9 July 2008}}</ref>

Like all [[felinae|felines]], they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding forepaw, minimizing noise and visible tracks.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. The two back legs allow falling and leaping far distances without injury.

Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a ""pacing"" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a ""diagonal"" gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move simultaneously. Cat height can vary depending on breed and/or gender, but is usually around 12 inches or 30.5 centimeters<ref name=""Christensen 2004"">{{Cite book

Like nearly all members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Felidae]], cats have retractable [[claw]]s. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the [[skin]] and [[fur]] around the [[paw|toe pads]]. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Outline of Cat Lessons|journal=The School Journal|date=22 December 1900|first=Annetta F.|last=Armes|volume=LXI|issue=|page=659|id= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-_gBAAAAYAAJ|format=|accessdate=12 November 2007 }}</ref> Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, ""[[Kneading (cats)|kneading]]"", or for extra traction on soft surfaces (bedspreads, thick rugs, skin, etc.). It is also possible to make a cooperative cat extend its claws by carefully pressing both the top and bottom of the paw. The curved claws can become entangled in carpet or thick fabric, which can cause injury if the cat is unable to free itself.

Most cats have a total of 18 digits and claws. 5 on each forefoot, the 5th digit being the [[dewclaw]]; and 4 on each hind foot. The dewclaw is located high on the foreleg, is not in contact with the ground and is non-weight bearing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cats Claws further reading|url=http://www.cat-talk-101.com/cat-claws.html|website=Cat Talk 101.com|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref>

== Skin ==
Cats possess rather loose skin; this allows them to turn and confront a predator or another cat in a fight, even when it has a grip on them. This is also an advantage for [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] purposes, as it simplifies [[Injection (medicine)|injections]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Vaccinate Your Cat at Home | url = http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=87 | accessdate = 18 October 2006}}</ref> In fact, the lives of cats with [[renal failure|kidney failure]] can sometimes be extended for years by the regular injection of large volumes of fluid subcutaneously, which serves as an alternative to [[dialysis]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Cat Comes Back | url = http://www.wgrz.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=37606 | accessdate = 1 March 2010|author=Kellman, Rich }}{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = How to Give Subcutaneous Fluids to a Cat | url = http://www.wikihow.com/Give-Subcutaneous-Fluids-to-a-Cat | accessdate = 18 October 2006|work=wikihow.com}}</ref>

; Scruff
The particularly loose skin at the back of the neck is known as the ''[[nape|scruff]]'', and is the area by which a mother cat grips her [[kitten]]s to carry them. As a result, cats tend to become quiet and passive when gripped there. This behavior also extends into adulthood, when a male will grab the female by the scruff to immobilize her while he mounts, and to prevent her from running away as the mating process takes place.<ref>{{cite web | title = Scruffing your dog or cat | url = http://www.pets.ca/articles/article_scruffing.htm |work=pets.c| accessdate = 26 February 2008}}</ref>

This technique can be useful when attempting to treat or move an uncooperative cat. However, since an adult cat is heavier than a kitten, a pet cat should never be carried by the scruff, but should instead have its weight supported at the rump and hind legs, and at the chest and front paws.{{Or|date=August 2010}}

; Primordial pouches
Some cats share common traits due to heredity. One of those is the primordial pouch, sometimes referred to as ""spay sway"" by owners who notice it once the cat has been spayed or neutered. It is located on a cat's belly. Its appearance is similar to a loose flap of skin that might occur if the cat had been overweight and had then lost weight. It provides a little extra protection against kicks, which are common during cat fights as a cat will try to rake with its rear claws. In wild cats, the ancestors of domesticated felines, this pouch appears to be present to provide extra room in case the animal has the opportunity to eat a large meal and the stomach needs to expand. This stomach pouch also allows the cat to bend and expand, allowing for faster running and higher jumping.<ref>[http://pets.thenest.com/primordial-pouch-cats-11178.html What Is the Primordial Pouch in Cats? by Nicholas DeMarino at pets.thenest.com]</ref>

[[File:Cat skeleton.jpg|thumb|Cat skeleton]]
Cats have seven [[cervical vertebrae]] like almost all [[mammals]], thirteen [[thoracic vertebrae]] (humans have twelve), seven [[lumbar vertebrae]] (humans have five), three [[sacrum|sacral vertebrae]] (humans have five because of their bipedal posture), and, except for [[Manx (cat)|Manx cat]]s and other shorter tailed cats, twenty-two or twenty-three [[caudal vertebrae]] (humans have three to five, fused into an internal [[coccyx]]). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the ''[[tail]]'', used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements.  Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.

Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating [[clavicle]] bones, which allows them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.<ref name=""Gillis 2002"">{{cite web

==Muscles==
[[File:Superficial muscles of a cat.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Labelled diagram of the muscular system of a cat|Diagram of the muscular system of a cat]]

===Internal Abdominal Oblique===

This muscle's origin is the lumbodorsal fascia and ribs. Its [[insertion (anatomy)|insertion]] is at the pubis and [[Linea alba (abdomen)|linea alba]] (via aponeurosis), and its action is the compression of abdominal contents. It also laterally flexes and rotates the vertebral column.

===Transversus Abdominis===

This muscle is the innermost abdominal muscle. Its origin is the second sheet of the lumbodorsal fascia and the pelvic girdle and its insertion is the linea alba. Its action is the compression of the abdomen.

===Rectus Abdominis===

To see this muscle, first remove the extensive aponeurosis situated on the [[ventral]] surface of the cat. Its fibers are extremely longitudinal, on each side of the linea alba. It is also traversed by the inscriptiones tendinae, or what others called ''[[myosepta]]''.

===Deltoid===
The '''deltoid muscles''' lie just lateral to the [[trapezius muscles]], originating from several fibers spanning the clavicle and scapula, converging to insert at the humerus. Anatomically, there are only two deltoids in the cat, the ''acromiodeltoid'' and the ''spinodeltoid''. However, to conform to [[human anatomy]] standards, the clavobrachialis is now also considered a deltoid and is commonly referred to as the ''clavodeltoid''.

====Acromiodeltoid====
The acromiodeltoid is the shortest of the deltoid muscles. It lies lateral to (to the side of) the clavodeltoid, and in a more husky cat it can only be seen by lifting or reflecting the clavodeltoid. It originates at the acromion process and inserts at the deltoid ridge. When contracted, it raises and rotates the humerus outward.

====Spinodeltoid====
A stout and short muscle lying posterior to the acromiodeltoid. It lies along the lower border of the scapula, and it passes through the upper arm, across the upper end of muscles of the upper arm. It originates at the spine of the scapula and inserts at the deltoid ridge. Its action is to raise and rotate the humerus outward.

===Head===

====Masseter====
The '''Masseter''' is a great, powerful, and very thick muscle covered by a tough, shining [[fascia]] lying [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] to the [[zygomatic arch]], which is its origin. It inserts into the [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] half of the [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] surface of the [[mandible]]. Its action is the elevation of the mandible (closing of the jaw).

====Temporalis====
The '''temporalis''' is a great mass of mandibular muscle, and is also covered by a tough and shiny fascia. It lies [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] to the zygomatic arch and fills the [[temporal fossa]] of the [[skull]]. It arises from the side of the skull and inserts into the coronoid process of the mandible. It too, elevates the jaw.

===Integumental===
The two main integumentary muscles of a cat are the ''[[platysma]]'' and the ''cutaneous maximus''. The ''cutaneous maximus'' covers the dorsal region of the cat and allows it to shake its skin. The ''platysma'' covers the neck and allows the cat to stretch the skin over the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles.

===Neck and back===

====Rhomboideus====
The Rhomboideus is a thick, large muscle below the [[Trapezius muscles]]. It extends from the vertebral border of the scapula to the mid-dorsal line. Its origin is from the neural spines of the first four thoracic vertebrae, and its insertion is at the vertebral border of the scapula. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal.

====Rhomboideus Capitis====
The Rhomboideus capitis is the most cranial of the deeper muscles. It is underneath the [[Trapezius muscles|Clavotrapezius]]. Its origin is the superior nuchal line, and its insertion is at the scapula. Action draws scapula cranially.

====Splenius====
The Splenius is the most superficial of all the deep muscles. It is a thin, broad sheet of muscle underneath the [[Trapezius muscles|Clavotrapezius]] and deflecting it. It is crossed also by the Rhomboideus capitis. Its origin is the mid-dorsal line of the neck and fascia. The insertion is the superior nuchal line and atlas. It raises or turns the head.

====Serratus Ventralis====
The Serratus Ventralis is exposed by cutting the wing-like [[Latissimus Dorsi]]. The said muscle is covered entirely by [[adipose tissue]]. The origin is from the first nine or ten ribs and from part of the cervical vertebrae.

====Serratus Dorsalis====
The Serratus Dorsalis is medial to both the scapula and the Serratus Ventralis. Its origin is via apoeurosis following the length of the mid-dorsal line, and its insertion is the dorsal portion of the last ribs. Its action is to depress and retracts the ribs during breathing.

====Intercostals====
The Intercostals are a set of muscles sandwiched among the ribs. They interconnect ribs, and are therefore the primary respiratory skeletal muscles. They are divided into the ''external'' and the ''internal subscapularis''. The origin and insertion are in the ribs. The intercostals pull the ribs backwards or forwards.

====Caudofemoralis====
The [[Caudofemoralis]] is a muscle found in the pelvic limb. <ref>Rosenzweig, L. J. (1990). ''Anatomy of the Cat: Text and Dissection Guide''. Wm. C. Brown Publishers Dubuque, IA. p. 110, {{ISBN|0697055795}}.</ref> The Caudofemoralis acts to flex the tail laterally to its respective side when the pelvic limb is bearing weight. When the pelvic limb is lifted off the ground, contraction of the Caudofemoralis causes the limb to abduct and the shank to extend by extending the hip joint.

===Pectoral===

====Pectoantebrachialis====
Pectoantebrachialis muscle is just one-half inch wide and is the most superficial in the pectoral muscles. Its origin is the [[manubrium]] of the [[sternum]], and its insertion is in a flat [[tendon]] on the [[fascia]] of the proximal end of the [[ulna]]. Its action is to draw the arm towards the [[chest]]. There is no human equivalent.

====Pectoralis Major====
The pectoralis major, also called ''pectoralis superficialis'', is a broad triangular portion of the pectoralis muscle which is immediately below the pectoantebrachialis. It is smaller than the pectoralis minor muscle. Its origin is the [[sternum]] and median ventral raphe, and its insertion is at the [[humerus]]. Its action is to draw the [[arm]] towards the [[chest]].

====Pectoralis Minor====
The pectoralis minor muscle is larger than the Pectoralis major. However, most of its anterior border is covered by the pectoralis major. Its origins are ribs three–five, and its insertion is the coracoid process of the scapula. Its actions are the tipping of the scapula and the elevation of ribs three–five.

====Xiphihumeralis====
The most posterior, flat, thin, and long strip of pectoral muscle is the Xiphihumeralis. It is a band of parallel fibers that is found in felines but not in humans. Its origin is the Xiphoid Process of the sternum. The insertion is the humerus.

===Trapezius===
In the [[cat]] there are three thin flat muscles that cover the back, and to a lesser extent, the neck. They pull the scapula toward the mid-dorsal line, anteriorly, and posteriorly.

====Clavotrapezius====
The most anterior of the trapezius muscles, it is also the largest. Its fibers run obliquely to the ventral surface. Its origin is the superior nuchal line and median dorsal line and its insertion is the [[clavicle]]. Its action is to draw the clavicle dorsally and towards the head.

====Acromiotrapezius====
Acromiotrapezius is the middle trapezius muscle. It covers the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the scapula. Its origin is the neural spines of the cervical vertebrae and its insertion is in the metacromion process and fascia of the clavotrapezius. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal, and hold the two scapula together.

====Spinotrapezius====
Spinotrapezius, also called ''thoracic trapezius'', is the most posterior of the three. It is triangular shaped. Posterior to the acromiotrapezius and overlaps latissimus dorsi on the front. Its origin is the neural spines of the thoracic vertebrae and its insertion is the scapular fascia. Its action is to draw the scapula to the dorsal and caudal region.
==Digestive system==
The beginning of the digestion system of cats begins with their sharp teeth. Their sharp teeth help them tear meat which is most if not all of their diet. Cats naturally do not have a diet high in carbohydrates, and therefore, their saliva doesn’t contain the enzyme amylase.<ref>https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system</ref>Food moves from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach. The gastrointestinal tract of domestic cats contains a small cecum and unsacculated colon.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DZuAsci2apAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=cat+digestive+system&ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&q=cat%20&f=false</ref> The cecum while similar to dogs, doesn’t have a coiled cecum. The stomach of the cat can be divided into distinct regions of motor activity. The proximal end of the stomach relaxes when food is digested.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DZuAsci2apAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=cat+digestive+system&ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&q=cat%20&f=false</ref>While food is being digested this portion of the stomach either has rapid stationary contractions or a sustained tonic contraction of muscle.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DZuAsci2apAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=cat+digestive+system&ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&q=cat%20&f=false</ref> These different actions result in either the food being moved around or the food moving towards the distal portion of the stomach.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DZuAsci2apAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=cat+digestive+system&ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&q=cat%20&f=false</ref>The distal portion of the stomach undergoes rhythmic cycles of partial depolarization.<ref>https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system</ref>This depolarization sensitizes muscle cells so they are more likely to contract. The stomach is not only a muscular structure, it also serves a chemical function by releasing hydrochloric acid and other digestive enzymes to break down food. Food moves from the stomach into the small intestine. The first part of the small intestine is the duodenum. As food moves through the duodenum it mixes with bile, a fluid that neutralizes stomach acid and emulsifies fat. Bile is created in the liver and stored in the gall bladder. The pancreas releases enzymes that aid in digestion so that nutrients can be broken down and pass through the intestinal mucosa into the blood and travel to the rest of the body.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=DZuAsci2apAC&oi=fnd&pg=PR15&dq=cat+digestive+system&ots=rMq-0Omu5Q&sig=lpIgnRMTUiy4RO2QFoWI9WMiGVo#v=onepage&q=cat%20&f=false</ref>The pancreas doesn’t produce starch processing enzymes because cats don’t eat a diet high in carbohydrates.<ref>https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system</ref>   Since the cat digests low amounts of glucose, the pancreas uses amino acids to trigger insulin release instead of glucose. Food then moves on to the jejunum. This is the most nutrient absorptive section of the small intestine. The liver regulates the level of nutrients absorbed into the blood system from the small intestine. From the jejunum, whatever food that has not been absorbed is sent to the ileum which connects to the large intestine.<ref>http://www.cat-health-detective.com/cat-digestive-system.html</ref>The first part of the large intestine is the cecum and the second portion is the colon. The large intestine reabsorbs water and forms fecal matter. There are some things that the cats are not able to digest. For example, cats clean themselves by licking their fur with their tongue, which causes them to swallow a lot of fur. This causes a build-up of fur in a cat’s stomach and creates a mass of fur. This is often thrown up and is better known as a hair ball.<ref>https://www.vetinfo.com/cat-digestive-diseases.html</ref> The short length of the digestive tract of the cat causes cats’ digestive system to weigh less than other species of animals, which allows cats to be active predators.<ref>https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system</ref> While cats are well adapted to be predators they have a limited ability to regulate catabolic enzymes of amino acids meaning amino acids are constantly being destroyed and not absorbed.<ref>https://www.cathealth.com/digestive-system/cat-digestive-system</ref>Therefore, cats have a higher protein requirement in their diet than many other species. Cats are not adapted to synthesize niacin from tryptophan and because they are carnivores can’t convert carotene to vitamin A so eating plants while not harmful does not provide them nutrients. Understanding the digestive system of a domestic cat is very important for pet owners. If a pet owner understands how the different parts work together then if a problem occurs they could potentially help the cat’s situation even before taking it to a vet.

[[File:Penis-cat.jpg|thumb|[[Penile spines]] of a domestic cat]]

===Female genitalia===
In the female cat, the genitalia include two gonads, the uterus, the vagina, the genital passages and teats. Together with the vulva, the [[vagina]] of the cat is involved in mating and provides a channel for newborns during ''parturition'', or birth. The vagina is long and wide.<ref name=aniwa>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929122935/http://www.aniwa.com/en/general/Grand_Public/document/100358/28398/index.htm  The cat's genital system and reproduction]. aniwa.com</ref> Genital passages are the [[oviducts]] of the cat.

[[File:Catsrepublic.jpg|thumbnail||275px|Cat cafe ""Cats Republic"" Saint Petersburg, Russia]]

A '''cat café''' is a theme [[café]] whose attraction is [[cat]]s that can be watched and played with. Patrons pay a [[Cover charge|cover fee]], generally hourly, and thus cat cafés can be seen as a form of supervised indoor [[pet rental]].

== Etymology ==
''Cat café'' has been officially recognized in the online edition of the [[Oxford Dictionary of English]] since August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=New words in oxforddictionaries|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/hangry-bants-fatberg-new-words-in-oxforddictionaries|accessdate=28 August 2015}}<br/>{{Cite news|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-life-manspread-idUSKCN0QW1Y620150827|title = Manspreading, hangry, Grexit join Oxford online dictionary|date = 27 Aug 2015|work = |access-date = |publisher = Reuters}}</ref>

==History==
The world's first cat café, ""Cat Garden"" (貓花園<ref name=""NBP"">[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei BP]] : [http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/column/20080422/1009762/ Article on 2 May 2008] {{jp icon}}</ref>), opened its doors in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, in 1998.<ref name=""bbc_20120402"">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20120402-worldwide-weird-feline-fun-in-japans-cat-cafes|title=BBC - Travel - Feline fun in Japan's cat cafes|first=Lindsey | last=Galloway|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> The Taiwanese cat café eventually became a tourist destination, attracting tourists from Japan as well as all over the globe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/56592/brief-history-cat-cafe|title=A Brief History of the Cat Café|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref> Though the origin of cat café is in Taiwan, the concept blossomed in Japan,<ref name=""bbc_20120402""/> where the first one named ""Neko no Jikan"" (lit. ""Cat's Time"") was opened in [[Osaka]] in 2004.<ref name=""NBP""/> Due to the Japan's land size and population, many residents live in small apartments or condominiums which do not allow pets, making a cat café a very popular destination for young workers looking for the companionship and comfort offered. Tokyo's first cat café, named ""Neko no mise"" (Shop of Cats), opened in 2005. After this, the popularity of cat cafés boomed in Japan. From 2005 to 2010, seventy-nine cat cafés opened across the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vice.com/read/meow-meow-meow-329-v17n2|title=Meow Meow Meow|first=Tomo | last=Kosuga|work=VICE|accessdate=7 January 2016}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In the United Kingdom animal charities disagree on whether cat cafés are a suitable environment for cats with the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]], [[Cats Protection]] and the [[Celia Hammond#Celia Hammond Animal Trust|Celia Hammond Animal Trust]] criticizing them for keeping large numbers of cats in a confined space with a revolving population of people. International Cat Care takes a more positive view saying ""It is a difficult environment to get right but it's not impossible by any means"". However, all the charities agree that cat cafés need to be properly regulated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Are cat cafes good for cats?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37199653|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=BBC News|date=13 September 2016}}</ref>

The popularity of cat cafés in Japan is attributed to many apartments forbidding pets, and to cats providing relaxing companionship in what may otherwise be a stressful and lonesome urban life. Other forms of [[pet rental]], such as rabbit cafés, are also common in Japan.<ref>""[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120216f2.html?fb_ref=article_japantimes Tokyo's rabbit cafes hopping with customers].""

There are various types of cat cafés in Japan. Some feature specific categories of cat such as [[black cat]]s, fat cats, rare [[cat breed|breed]] cats or ex-[[feral cat|stray cat]]s. Every cat café in Japan is required to obtain a license and comply with the strict requirements and regulations of the nation's Animal Treatment and Protection Law.<ref>Iwata, Mamiko, [[About.com|All About]] : [http://allabout.co.jp/pet/cat/closeup/CU20100051A/ Article on 7 March 2010] {{jp icon}}</ref>

Japanese cat cafés feature strict rules to ensure cleanliness and animal welfare, in particular seeking to ensure that the cats are not disturbed by excessive and unwanted attention, such as by young children or when sleeping. Many cat cafés also seek to raise awareness of cat welfare issues, such as abandoned and stray cats and many often have cats from local animal shelters to help them lose any fear of humans and advertise them for possible adoption. From 2012 the cats could be displayed until 8&nbsp;pm, but in 2016 the guidelines of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|environment ministry]] state that they may visit  and play with customers until 10&nbsp;pm.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/wtf/cats-at-japans-cat-cafes-now-allowed-to-stay-up-till-10pm/news-story/ab6955ba24d2af012438cd4c6b999c4a Cats at Japan's ‘cat cafes’ now allowed to stay up till 10pm 28 April 2016] ''News.com.au'' Retrieved 3 May 2016</ref>

According to local legend, the world's first cat café opened in Vienna in the summer of 1912 and ceased operation approximately two years later. It is said that Vladimir Lenin was a regular for a period in 1913, finding the feline companionship a comfort during his time of exile. The cat café is known to have ceased operation shortly after the beginning of the First World War, although the much repeated story that the closure was due to its patriotic owner's donating all the cats to a factory making fur-lined boots for the war effort may be apocryphal.<ref>https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-oldie/20151209/282218009716840</ref> In 2012 cat café Neko was opened in Vienna.

In the United States, compliance with governmental food service regulations is required.  The area where the cats are playing or being considered for adoption must be entirely separated from the area where food and drink are served. For example, a newly adopted cat must leave through a separate door without passing a food serving area.<ref name=""webcat"">{{cite web|title=What's a Cat Cafe?|url=http://www.catcafesd.com/us/whats-a-cat-cafe/|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>

Cat cafés in the United States differ from those in many other countries by their focus on adoptions. Hundreds of animals have been adopted through their efforts.

The '''[[genetics]] of [[cat]] coat''' coloration, pattern, length (short, medium or long), and texture is a complex subject, and many different [[gene]]s are involved. 
__TOC__
{{Clear}}

==Cat coat patterns and colors==
Cat coat genetics can produce a variety of colors and coat patterns. These are physical properties and should not be confused with a breed of cat. Furthermore, cats may show the color and/or pattern particular to a certain breed without actually being of that breed. For example, cats may have point coloration, but not be [[Siamese cat|Siamese]].

[[File:Co-kbk-07-001.jpg|thumb|Blue (grey) and white bicolor cat]]
; [[Bicolor cat|Bicolor, Tuxedo, and Van]] :This pattern varies between the [[Bicolor cat#Tuxedo cats|tuxedo cat]] which is mostly black with a white chest, and possibly markings on the face and paws/legs, all the way to the ''Van'' pattern (so named after the [[Lake Van]] area in Turkey, which gave rise to the [[Turkish Van]] breed), where the only colored parts of the cat are the tail (usually including the base of the tail proper), and the top of the head (often including the ears). There are several other terms for amounts of white between these two extremes, such as ''Harlequin''. Bicolor cats can have as their primary (non-white) color black, red, any dilution thereof, and tortoiseshell (see below for definition).

[[File:Felis silvestris - July 2007-1.jpg|thumb|Mackerel tabby, showing the characteristic ""M"" on its forehead.]]
; [[Tabby]] :Striped, with a variety of patterns. The classic blotched tabby (or marbled) pattern is the most common and consists of butterflies and bullseyes. The mackerel or striped tabby is a series of vertical stripes down the cat's side (resembling the fish). This pattern broken into spots is referred to as a spotted tabby. In addition, the individual hairs in a tabby-patterned coat may be banded with different colors, hence a ""ticked"" tabby. The worldwide evolution of the cat means that certain types of tabby are associated with certain countries; for instance, blotched tabbies are quite rare outside NW Europe, where they are the most common type.

[[File:Curlycat02.jpg|thumb|Female tortoiseshell-and-white cat]]
; [[Tortoiseshell cat|Tortoiseshell]] and [[Calico cat|calico]]
: This cat is also known as a calimanco cat or clouded tiger cat, and by the abbreviation 'tortie'. In the cat fancy, a tortoiseshell cat is patched over with red (or its dilute form, cream) and black (or its dilute blue) mottled throughout the coat. Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a 'tortoiseshell and white' cat; if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, in North America the cat will be called a calico. All calicos are tortoiseshell (as they carry both black and red), but not all tortoiseshells are calicos (which requires a significant amount of white in the fur and patching rather than mottling of the colors). The calico is also sometimes called a tricolor cat. The Japanese refer to this pattern as ''mi-ke'' (meaning ""triple fur""), while the Dutch call these cats ''lapjeskat'' (meaning ""patches cat""). A true tricolor must consist of three colors: a reddish color, dark or light; white; and one other color, typically a brown, black, or blue.<ref>{{cite web |title=Torties, Calicos and Tricolor Cats |first=Barbara |last=French |url= http://www.fanciers.com/cat-faqs/tricolors.shtml |work=Fanciers.com |accessdate=24 October 2005}}{{self-published source|date=November 2011}}</ref> Both tortoiseshell and calico cats are typically female because the coat pattern is the result of differential [[X chromosome]] [[x-inactivation|inactivation]] in females (which, as with all normal female mammals, have two X chromosomes). Conversely, cats where the overall color is ginger (orange) are commonly male (roughly in a 3:1 ratio). In a litter sired by a ginger tom, the females will be tortoiseshell or ginger. Male tortoiseshells can occur as a result of chromosomal abnormalities (often linked to sterility) or by a phenomenon known as [[chimera (genetics)|chimerism]], where two early stage embryos are merged into a single kitten.  The manifestation of coloured patches on both males and females is termed mosaicism.

[[File:Niobe050905-Siamese Cat.jpeg|thumb|[[Siamese cat]], classical colorpoint pattern]]

; [[Point coloration|Colorpoint]]
: The colorpoint pattern is most commonly associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter version of the same color on the rest of the body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a [[Mutation#Special classes|temperature sensitive mutation]] in one of the [[enzyme]]s in the [[metabolic pathway]] from [[tyrosine]] to pigment, such as [[melanin]]; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.

: The tyrosine pathway also produces [[neurotransmitter]]s, thus mutations in the early parts of that pathway may affect not only pigment, but also neurological development. This results in a higher frequency of [[strabismus|cross-eyes]] among colorpointed cats, as well as the [[White tiger#Genetics and albinism|high frequency of cross-eyes in white tigers]].

; White cats
[[File:Cat Gato branco.jpg|thumb|White cat]]
: True albinism (a mutation of the tyrosinase gene) is quite rare in cats. Much more common is the appearance of white coat color that is caused by a lack of [[melanocyte]]s in the skin. A [[Melanin#Genetic disorders and disease states|higher frequency of deafness in white cats]] is due to a reduction in the population and survival of melanoblast stem cells, which in addition to creating pigment-producing cells, develop into a variety of neurological cell types. White cats with one or two blue eyes have a particularly high likelihood of being deaf.

; Smoke cats
: The bottom eighth of each hair is white or creamy-white, with the rest of the hair being a solid color. Genetically this color is a non-[[agouti signalling peptide|agouti]] cat with the dominant inhibitor gene; a non-agouti version of the silver [[tabby cat|tabby]]. Smoke cats will look solid colored until they move, when the white undercoat becomes apparent. It is mostly found in [[cat breed|pedigreed cat]]s (especially longhair breeds) but also present in some [[domestic long-haired cat]]s.

== Genes involved in albinism, dominant white, and white spotting ==
[[File:Neighbours Siamese.jpg|thumb|250px|The temperature sensitive albino genotype c<sup>s</sup>c<sup>s</sup> produces [[point coloration]] at body extremities where lower temperature allows the mutated tyrosinase enzyme to become active.]]

* The ""C"" gene codes for the enzyme [[tyrosinase]], the first step in pigment production. Its [[Recessive gene|recessive alleles]] determine whether a cat is a complete [[albinism|albino]] (pink-eyed) or a temperature sensitive albino. The temperature sensitive albino genotypes are c<sup>b</sup>c<sup>b</sup> [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] (sepia), c<sup>s</sup>c<sup>s</sup> [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] (pointed), and c<sup>b</sup>c<sup>s</sup> [[Tonkinese cat|Tonkinese]] (mink). The c<sup>s</sup>c<sup>s</sup> gene can turn a cat's eyes blue due to a reduced number of [[melanocytes]], affecting pigmentation of the eyes. If a cat has the dominant C allele, then the cat is non-albino and full pigment production occurs.
* The ''white masking'' gene, ''W/w''. The ""W"" gene prevents the normal replication and migration of pigment-producing cells during embryologic development. As a result, ''WW'' and ''Ww'' cats have a greatly reduced number of [[melanocytes]] and appear white, no matter what other color genes it may carry.  Only a cat that is [[homozygous]] [[recessive]] (''ww'') will express normal pigmentation. Thus, ''W'' is [[epistasis|epistatic]] to the other coat pigmentation genes. Some cats with the ''W'' allele of this gene are deaf and/or have depigmentation of the iris of one or both eyes, resulting in blue eye color. White cats are also more likely to get skin cancer.
* The ''white spotting'' or ''piebald spotting'' gene, ''S/s'', has variable expression, so that an ''SS'' cat often has more extensive white patching than an ''Ss'' cat. It is this gene that creates the familiar white blaze across the face, a white bib, ''tuxedo'' pattern, or dappled paws.  A hypothetical Sb allele (""gloving gene"") may cause the mittens in [[Birman]] and [[Snowshoe (cat)|Snowshoe]] breeds.  Some researchers believe that there are separate white spotting genes for distinct forms of white pattern, such as the white locket that some cats have on their neck or bellies.

== Genes involved in red, black, brown, and diluted colors ==
[[File:Tortoiseshell Cat.jpg|thumb|250px|A female domestic shorthair [[tortoiseshell cat]].]]
[[File:Red Cat in Torzhok City.jpg|thumb|250px|This probably male cat shows the ""red"" O- genotype, with ll for long hair (though not show-quality), ss for absence of white spotting, and at least one Mc gene for the mackerel tabby pattern]]
[[File:Female Calico Cat.jpg|thumb|250px|A female [[Calico cat]].]]
* The sex-linked ''red'' gene, ''O'', determines whether there will be red variations to fur color.<ref name=""fanciers"">{{cite web|url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/color-genetics |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Cat Color Genetics |publisher=Fanciers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>  This gene is located on the X chromosome.  In cats with red variants of fur tone, [[phaeomelanin]] (red pigment) completely replaces eumelanin (black or brown pigment).<ref name=""fanciers""/>
* Males have only one X chromosome, so only have one allele of this gene. O results in red variations, and o results in non-orange fur.
* Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two alleles of this gene. OO results in red toned fur, oo results in non-orange fur, and Oo results in a [[tortoiseshell cat]], in which some parts of the fur are red variants and others areas non-red.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/felinegenetics/a/colorpatterns.htm |title=Feline Breeds, Domestic Cats and Color Patterns |publisher=Cats.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>
A cat with Oo and white spotting genes is commonly called a [[calico cat|calico]].  The reason for the patchwork effect in female cats heterozygous for the O gene (Oo) is [[X-inactivation]] – one or the other X chromosome in every cell in the embryo is randomly inactivated (see [[Barr body]]), and the gene in the other X chromosome is expressed.
* [[Rufous polygenes]], as yet unidentified, can affect the richness of the orange/red gene's expression.

For a cat to be tortoiseshell, calico, or one of the variants such as blue-cream or chocolate tortoiseshell, the cat must simultaneously express two [[allele]]s, ''O'' and ''o'', which are located on the [[XY sex-determination system|X chromosome]]. Males normally cannot do this, as they have only one X chromosome, and therefore only one allele, and so calico cats are normally only female. Male tortoiseshell or calico cats occur only if they have chromosomal abnormalities such as the genotype XXY (in which case they are [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]]), [[Mosaic (genetics)|chromosomal mosaicism]] (only portions of their cells have the genotype XXY, so these cats may be fertile), or [[Chimera (genetics)|chimerism]] (a single individual formed from two fused embryos, at least one of which was male). Approximately 1 in 3,000 calico/tortoiseshell cats are male.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=2209&S=5 | title=Feline Fallacies | work=The Pet Connection | publisher=VeterinaryPartner.com | first=Gina | last=Spadafori | accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> Chimericism (which may result in fertile male cats) appears to be the most common mechanism.

=== Genes ===
* The browning gene ''B/b/b<sup>l</sup>'' codes for tyrosinase related protein-1, an enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway for eumelanin pigment production. Its dominant form, ''B'', will produce black color.  Recessive variants are ''b'', producing brown (or ''chocolate''), and ''b<sup>l</sup>'' producing light brown or ''cinnamon''.
* ''Barrington Brown'' is a recessive browning gene that dilutes black to mahogany, brown to light brown and chocolate to pale coffee.  It is different from the browning gene and has only been observed in laboratory cats.
* The ''Dense pigment'' gene, ''D/d'', codes for [[melanophilin]], a protein involved in the transportation and deposition of pigment into a growing hair. When a cat has two of the recessive ''d'' alleles (Maltese dilution), black fur becomes ""blue"" (appearing gray), chocolate fur becomes ""lilac"" (appearing light brown), cinnamon fur becomes fawn, and orange fur becomes cream.
* Dilution modifier gene, Dm, ""caramelizes"" the dilute colors as a dominant trait. The existence of this phenomenon as a discrete gene is a controversial subject among feline enthusiasts.
*  A mutation at the extension locus ''E/e'' (the [[melanocortin]] receptor) changes black pigment to amber or light amber. This phenomenon was first identified in [[Norwegian forest cat|Norwegian Forest Cats]].
* A modifying factor has also been hypothesized in shaded silver and chinchilla [[Persian cat|Persians]] whose fur turns pale golden in adulthood, due to low levels of phaeomelanin production. These cats resemble shaded or tipped goldens, but are genetically shaded or tipped silvers. This is probably related to the phenomenon known as ""tarnishing"" in silvers.

One can deduce that a grey male cat with a white bib and paws, but showing no tabby pattern:
*has the ''o'' variant of the orange gene on its only X chromosome (because the grey color corresponds to black, not orange)
*has at least one ''S'' variant of the white Spotting gene (because it has the white bib and paws)
*has two ''w'' alleles (because it expresses a fur color)
*has the dominant ''B'' allele (because its fur color is a shade of black rather than brown)
*has two ''d'' (dilute) alleles (because its fur is grey, rather than black).

== Genes involved in fur pattern and shading ==
[[File:CAT2007 05 16.jpg|thumb|250px|A mackerel tabby with the classic ""M"" on forehead.]]
[[File:Orange tabby with green eyes.JPG|thumb|250px|An orange tabby with facial markings and nose spot.]]
[[File:Grey classic tabby.jpg|thumb|250px|The recessive mutant gene ''mc'' produces the blotched or classic tabby pattern.]]
[[File:Tabby face markings.JPG|thumb|250px|A Brown Mackerel [[tabby cat]] with pencil lines on the face.]]
[[File:Mekong bobtail lynx point, Cofein Pride.jpg|thumb|250px|A tabby point on a Mekong bobtail.]]

* The [[agouti gene]], ''A/a'' which codes for [[agouti signaling protein]].  The dominant, wild-type ''A'' causes the agouti shift phenomenon which causes hairs to be black pigmented at the tips and orange pigmented at the roots (revealing the underlying tabby pattern), while the recessive ''non-agouti'' or ""hypermelanistic"" allele, ''a'', prevents this shift in the pigmentation pathway.  In its homozygous form, aa, this results in black pigment production throughout the growth cycle of the hair.  Thus, the non-agouti genotype (aa) masks or hides the tabby pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can be seen (called ""ghost striping""), especially in kittens.  The O allele is also [[epistatic]] over the aa genotype.  That is, the ''A'' to ''a'' mutation does not have a discernible effect on red or cream colored cats, resulting in these cats displaying tabby striping independent of their genotype at this locus.  This explains why you can usually see the tabby pattern in the orange patches of non-agouti tortoiseshell cats, but not in the black or brown patches.
* The primary [[tabby]] pattern gene, ''Mc/mc'', sets the basic pattern of stripes that underlies the coat: the basic wild-type tabby gene, ''Mc'', produces what is called a ''mackerel striped'' tabby (stripes look like thin fishbones and may break up into bars or spots); while a recessive mutant, ''mc'', produces a blotched or ''classic'' tabby pattern (broad bands, whorls, and spirals of dark color on pale background usually with bulls-eye or oyster pattern on flank), common in Iran, Great Britain and in lands that were once part of the British Empire and Persian Empire. The gene responsible for this differential patterning has been identified as ''transmembrane aminopeptidase Q'' (''Taqpep''), which also produces the [[king cheetah]] coat variant.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Specifying and Sustaining Pigmentation Patterns in Domestic and Wild Cats |author1=Kaelin CB |author2=Xu X |author3=Hong LZ |author4=David VA |author5=McGowan KA |author6=Schmidt-Küntzel A |author7=Roelke ME |author8=Pino J |author9=Pontius J |author10=Cooper GM |author11=Manuel H |author12=Swanson WF |author13=Marker L |author14=Harper CK |author15=van Dyk A |author16=Yue Bisong |author17=Mullikin JC |author18=Warren WC |author19=Eizirik E |author20=Kos L |author21=O'Brien SJ |author22=Barsh GS |author23=Menotti-Raymond M |year=2012 |journal=Science |pages=1536–1541|volume=337 |issue=6101 |pmid=22997338|doi=10.1126/science.1220893 |pmc=3709578}}</ref>
* Secondary [[tabby]] pattern genes such as ''T<sup>a</sup> / t<sup>a</sup>'', at which locus a dominant mutation produces an ''Abyssinian ticked'' or non-patterned agouti tabby, having virtually no stripes or bars.  (This is one type of unpatterned tabby; the other type of unpatterned tabby is the shaded/chinchilla. See inhibited pigment gene, below.)  The dominant ticked tabby allele masks all other tabby patterns.
* Other genes (''pattern modifier'' genes) are theorized to be responsible for creating various type of spotting patterns, many of which are variations on a basic mackerel or classic pattern.  There are also hypothetical factors which affect the timing and frequency of the agouti shift, affecting agouti band width and the number and quality of alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin on individual hairs.

=== Tabby cats ===
Tabby cats (AA or Aa), normally have:
* M on forehead. (Visible in ticked tabby cats, but hard to discern in shaded silver/golden, and tipped cats)
* Thin pencil lines on face. (Visible in ticked tabby cats, but hard to discern in shaded silver/golden, and tipped cats)
* Black ""eyeliner"" appearance and white or pale fur around eyeliner.
* Pigmented lips and paws.
* A pink nose outlined in darker pigment
* Torso, leg, and tail banding. (Torso banding disappears in the ticked tabby.)

Most or all striping disappears in the chinchilla or shaded cat, but it is still possible to identify the cat as a tabby from these other features.
* There is a gene, not yet identified but believed to be related to the agouti gene, in the [[Chausie]] breed, that produces silver-tipped black fur similar to [[Abyssinian cat|Abyssinian]] ticked fur. The ""grizzled"" phenomenon is purported to have been inherited from the hybridization of the domestic cat to the jungle cat (''Felis chaus'').
* The ''inhibited pigment'' gene, ''I/i''. The dominant allele (I) produces ''tipped'' hairs that are fully colored only at the tip and have a white base. This allele appears to interact with other genes to produce various degrees of tipping, ranging from deeply tipped silver tabby to lightly tipped shaded silver and chinchilla silver.  The inhibitor gene interacts with the non-agouti genotype (I-aa) to produce the color known as smoke. The homozygous recessive genotype when combined with the agouti gene (iiA-), produces tabby coloration, which can vary along a spectrum ranging from a deeply patterned brown tabby, to a lighter ""golden tabby"", to the very lightly colored shaded or chinchilla golden colors. Orange cats with the inhibitor gene (I-O-) are commonly called ""cameo"".

The genetics involved in producing the ideal tabby, tipped, shaded, or smoke cat is complex.  Not only are there many interacting genes, but genes sometimes do not express themselves fully, or conflict with one another.  For example, the melanin inhibitor gene sometimes does a poor job blocking pigment, resulting in an excessively gray undercoat, or in tarnishing (yellowish or rusty fur).

Likewise, poorly-expressed non-agouti or over-expression of melanin inhibitor will cause a pale, washed out black smoke. Various polygenes (sets of related genes), epigenetic factors, or modifier genes, as yet unidentified, are believed to result in different phenotypes of coloration, some deemed more desirable than others by fanciers.

=== Tipped or shaded cats ===
Here are the genetic influences on tipped or shaded cats:
* Agouti gene.
* Tabby pattern genes (such as T<sup>a</sup> masking the tabby pattern).
* Silver or melanin inhibitor gene.
* Factors affecting the number and width of bands of color on each hair (such as the hypothetical wide band gene).
* Factors affecting the amount and quality of eumelanin and/or phaeomelanin pigment expression (such as theorized rufousing factors)
* Genes causing sparkling appearance (such as ''glitter'' in the Bengal, ''satin'' in the Tennessee Rex, ''grizzle'' in the Chausie).
* Factors to clear up residual striping (hypothetical Chaos, Confusion, Unconfused, Erase, and Roan factors).

== Genes involved in fur length and texture ==

Cat fur length is governed by the ''Long hair'' gene in which the dominant form, ''[[domestic shorthaired cat|L]]'', codes for '''short''' hair, and the recessive ''[[domestic long-haired cat|l]]'' codes for '''long''' hair. In the longhaired cat, the transition from anagen (hair growth) to catagen (cessation of hair growth) is delayed due to this mutation. A rare recessive shorthair gene has been observed in some lines of Persian cat (silvers) where two longhaired parents have produced shorthaired offspring.

There have been many genes identified that result in unusual cat fur.  These genes were discovered in random-bred cats and selected for. Some of the genes are in danger of going extinct because the cats are not sold beyond the region where the mutation originated or there is simply not enough demand for cats expressing the mutation.

In many breeds, coat gene mutations are unwelcome. An example is the rex allele which appeared in Maine Coons in the early 1990s. Rexes appeared in America, Germany and the UK, where one breeder caused consternation by calling them ""Maine Waves"". Two UK breeders did test mating which indicated that this was probably a new rex mutation and that it was recessive. The density of the hair was similar to normally coated Maine Coons, but consisted only of down type hairs with a normal down type helical curl, which varied as in normal down hairs. Whiskers were more curved, but not curly. Maine Coons do not have awn hairs, and after moulting, the rexes had a very thin coat.

=== Curly coated ===
There are various genes producing curly coated or ""rex"" cats.  New types of rex pop up spontaneously in random-bred cats now and then.  Here are some of the rex genes that breeders have selected for:

* r = [[Cornish Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* gr (provisional) = [[German Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]]. Same [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] as Cornish, but proposed as a different [[allele]]. However, most breeders consider the German Rex to have r/r genotype.
* re = [[Devon Rex]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* ro = [[Oregon Rex]] (extinct), [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* Se = [[Selkirk Rex]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]] although sometimes described as an [[Dominance (genetics)#Incomplete dominance|incomplete dominant]] because the three possible allele pairings relate to three different phenotypes: heterozygous cats (Sese) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (SeSe) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume. (sese type cats have a normal coat.) This phenomenon may also colloquially be referred to as additive dominance.
* Lp (provisional) = [[LaPerm]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]]: Lp/lp and Lp/Lp individuals have the same phenotype.

=== Hairlessness ===
There are also genes for hairlessness:
* h = French hairless cat, [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* hd = British hairless cat, [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].
* Hp = Russian Donskoy and [[Peterbald]], [[Dominance (genetics)#Dominant allele|dominant]].
* hr = Canadian [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx cat]], [[Recessive gene#Recessive allele|recessive]].

Some rex cats are prone to temporary hairlessness, known as baldness, during moulting.

Here are a few other genes resulting in unusual fur:
* The Wh gene (dominant, possibly incomplete) results in [[American Wirehair|Wirehair]] cats.  They have bent or crooked hair producing springy, crinkled fur.
* A hypothetical Yuc gene, or [[York Chocolate cat|York Chocolate]] undercoat gene, results in cats with no undercoat. However, the proportional relationship between [[Guard hair|guard]], [[Awn hair|awn]], and [[down hair]] production varies greatly between all breeds.
* A recessive autosomal gene for ''Onion hair'' which causes roughness and swelling on the hairs.  The swelling is due to enlargement of the inner core of medulla cells.
* A recessive autosomal gene spf for ''sparse fur''.  As well as sparse coat, the hairs are thin, straggly and contorted and there is brown exudate around the eyes and nose and on the chest and stomach. A similar condition is linked to [[Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency]] in mice.

Cats having pinkish patches can be found in [[Bulgaria]]. The color is probably the result of a [[genetic mutation]] and is very close to orange. They are usually pink-white [[bicolor cat|bicolor]]; or pink-[[Russian Blue]]-white or pink-black-white [[calico cat]]s.

In Switzerland the private consumption and slaughter of dog and cat meat is permitted though its commercial trade is prohibited by law. A 1993 petition to ban consumption failed with the government declaring the matter a ""personal ethical choice.""

===Denmark===
In June 2008, three students at the Danish School of Media and Journalism published pictures of a cat being slaughtered in ''Citat'', a magazine for journalism students. Their goal was to create a debate about [[animal welfare]]. The cat was shot by its owner, a [[farmer]], and it would have been [[animal euthanasia|put down]] in any case. The farmer [[animal slaughter|slaughtered]] the cat all within the limits of [[Law of Denmark|Danish law]].

===Italy===
In February 2010, on a television cooking show, the [[Italy|Italian]] food writer Beppe Bigazzi mentioned that during the famine in [[World War II]] cat stew was a ""succulent"" and well known dish in his home area of [[Valdarno]], [[Tuscany]]. Later he claimed he had been joking, but added that cats used to be eaten in the area during famine periods, historically; he was widely criticised in the media for his comments and ultimately dropped from the television network.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article7029058.ece|title = Celebrity chef Beppe Bigazzi upsets viewers with his cat casserole|date = February 16, 2010 |publisher = The Times | location=London | first=Richard | last=Owen}}</ref>

According to the ""Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant"" in 1904, ''""Just before Christmas it is common for a group of young men in northern Italy to kill some cats, skin them and soak them in water for two or three days. They are cooked with great care on Christmas day and served up hot about 1.30 P. M., after mass. ""Many people in Italy, 'on the quiet,' keep cats like the English do rabbits—to kill. A catskin there is worth ten pence, as the material for muffs for girls. ""Extraordinary care has to be taken in procuring the animals, for the Italian Society for the Protection of Cats is vigilant, and offenses against the law are followed by imprisonment only. We have no fines in Italy.''<ref>{{cite book|title=Butchers' Advocate, Dressed Poultry and the Food Merchant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5tRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP53&dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEITzAJ#v=onepage&q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&f=false|year=1904|pages=11–}}</ref>

According to ""The Dietetic & Hygienic Gazette"" in 1905, ''Italy cultivates the cat for home consumption as English people raise rabbits. It is to be done on the quiet, however, for in spite of the profit in the business and the demand for the delicacy, the law has to be looked out for, and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Cats is vigilant. Offenses against the law are visited with imprisonment. Cats are raised for the market none the less. Fattened on the finest of milk, a choice specimen will attain the weight of fifteen pounds.''<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dietetic & Hygienic Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3w3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&f=false|year=1905|publisher=Gazette Publishing Company|pages=99–100}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Dietetic and Hygienic Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfEgAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=northern+italy+eat+cats&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik2qSL88LPAhXGGh4KHYk9ApkQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&q=northern%20italy%20eat%20cats&f=false|year=1905|publisher=Gazette Publishing Company|pages=99–100}}</ref>

===Australia===
[[Indigenous Australians]] in the area of [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory#Wild Cat Stew Challenge|Alice Springs]] roast feral cats on an open fire. They have also developed recipes for cat stew. Some other inhabitants of the area have also taken up this custom, justified on the grounds that felines are ""a serious threat to Australia's native [[fauna]]"".

===Peru===
Cat is not a regular menu item in [[Peru]], but is used in such dishes as [[fricassee]] and stews most abundant in two specific sites in the country: the southern town of [[Chincha Alta]] ([[Ica Region]], [[Afro-Peruvian]] mostly) and the north-central [[Andean]] town of [[Huari, Peru|Huari]] ([[Ancash Region]]). Primarily used by [[Afro-Peruvian]]s.

In October 2013, a judge banned the annual El Festival Gastronomico del Gato (the Gastronomic Festival of the Cat), which was held every September in La Quebrada to commemorate the arrival of settlers who were forced to eat cats to survive, citing it as cruel to the 100+ cats specifically bred for the event, which involves being kept in cages for a year prior the Festival. The judge also cited concerns over the safety of the meat, which drew criticism from residents who contend that cat meat is far richer than rabbit or duck, and that it has been long consumed globally without any deleterious effects.<ref>Golgowksi, Nina (October 15, 2013). [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/judge-bans-peruvian-town-annual-cat-eating-festival-article-1.1486233 ""Judge bans Peruvian town's annual cat-eating festival""]. ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' (New York).</ref>

That same month, magistrate Maria Luyo banned the festival of Curruñao in the small town of San Luis. Locals say that the festival, which sees cats being drowned, skinned and tied to fireworks and blown up, dates back to the practice of eating cat on the part of African slaves who worked on sugar-cane plantations in colonial times, and is part of the religious celebrations of [[Santa Efigenia]], an African-Peruvian folk saint. Luyo stated in her ruling that the festival ""fomented violence based on cruel acts against animals which caused grave social damage and damaged public health"", and that minors could be ""psychologically damaged"" by watching the events.<ref>Collyns, Dan (October 18, 2013).

===Argentina===
In a 1996, report some citizens in a [[shanty town]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]], stated that, during an economic crisis, they had to feed the neighborhood children with cat's meat, and commenting, ""It's not denigrating to eat cat, it keeps a child's stomach full"".

The cats remained in St. Petersburg except during [[World War II]],<ref name=BBCRodgers/> when the existing cat population was killed. A new group of cats replaced the previous cats since the rat population had increased.<ref name=Marquardt/>

In the late 1990s,<!--About 15 years before 2012 is 1997--> Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions.<ref name=McGrane/>

As of 2007 the museum began adopting cats needing homes.<ref name=BBCRodgers/>  

In 2011, the museum began a ""Catfest"", a celebration of its cat population. ""Catfest"" has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children.<ref name=McGrane/>

Beginning in 2015, because of the number of visiting tourists, a website has been set up by the museum for people who may be interested in adopting a cat. “It is an honor to adopt a Hermitage cat,” one potential cat owner was told.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/hermitage-museum-also-serves-as-cat-rescue-adoption-center/|title=Russia’s Hermitage Museum Is Filled With Cats|date=17 November 2015|publisher=''[[The Daily Observer]]''|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Unitarian Church Cat Therapy 4.JPG|thumb|right|Therapy cats have cuddled with many hospitals patients, offering comfort and companionship]]

A '''therapy cat''' is a cat trained to help ailing humans in a medically beneficial way to take advantage of the human-animal interaction for purposes of relaxation and healing. A therapy cat provides affection and comfort to people in retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, hospices, and other human service care facilities.

Therapy cats come in all sizes and breeds. The most important characteristic of a therapy cat is its temperament. A good therapy cat must be friendly, patient, confident, gentle, and at ease in all situations. Therapy cats must enjoy human contact and be content to be petted and handled, sometimes clumsily. Cats must demonstrate that loud noises and barking dogs do not bother them.

A therapy cat's primary job is to allow unfamiliar people to make physical contact with it and to enjoy that contact. Children in particular enjoy hugging animals; adults usually enjoy simply petting the cat. The cat might need to be lifted onto, or climb onto, an individual's lap or bed and sit or lie comfortably there. In hospice environments, therapy cats can play a role in palliative care by reducing death anxiety.

==Birds==
A 2013 study by Scott R. Loss and others of the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] suggested that free-ranging domestic cats (mostly unowned) are the top human-caused threat to wildlife in the United States, killing an estimated 1.3 to 4 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals annually.<ref name=""Loss 2013"">{{cite journal|url=http://www.alleycat.org/document.doc?id=634 |title=The impact of free-ranging domestic cats on wildlife of the United States|journal=Nature Communications|volume=4|pages=1396|doi=10.1038/ncomms2380|pmid=23360987|year=2013|last1=Loss|first1=Scott R.|last2=Will|first2=Tom|last3=Marra|first3=Peter P.}}</ref><ref name='BBCNews'>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21236690 | title = Cats killing billions of animals in the US | accessdate = 12 February 2013 | last = Morelle | first = Rebecca | date = 29 January 2013 | work = BBC News}}</ref> These figures were much higher than previous estimates for the U.S.<ref name=""Loss 2013""/>{{rp|2}} Unspecified species of birds native to the U.S. and mammals including [[mouse|mice]], [[shrew]]s, [[vole]]s, [[squirrel]]s and [[rabbit]]s were considered most likely to be preyed upon by cats.<ref name=""Loss 2013""/>{{rp|4}}

Perhaps the first U.S. study that pointed to predation by cats on wildlife as a concern was ornithologist [[Edward Howe Forbush]]'s 1916 report for the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, ''The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It''.<ref>Edward Howe Forbush, [https://archive.org/details/domesticcatbirdk00forbrich ""The Domestic Cat: Bird Killer, Mouser and Destroyer of Wildlife: Means of Utilizing and Controlling It""], Commonwealth of Massachusetts, State Board of Agriculture, Economic Biology Bulletin 42, 1916.</ref>

U.K. biologist and cat behaviour expert Roger Tabor states that ""studies from all around the world have found that cats catch relatively few birds compared to small mammals.""<ref name=""Tabor Cat Behavior"">Tabor, Roger (2003) ''Understanding Cat Behavior''. David & Charles Ltd. {{ISBN|9780715315897}}.</ref>{{rp|135}} The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation ""is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide.""<ref name=""Are cats causing bird declines?"">
[http://www.rspb.org.uk/advice/gardening/unwantedvisitors/cats/birddeclines.aspx ""Are cats causing bird declines?""] The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, accessed 23 June 2014.</ref> Moreover, city cats have smaller ranges. In his research, Tabor found ""the average annual catch of the average London cat to be two items instead of the fourteen of a village cat.""<ref name=""Tabor Cat Behavior""/>{{rp|135}} Tabor comments about some of the challenges of stalking birds for cats: ""From the cat's point of view not only do birds not play fair by flying and having eyes that can see beyond the back of their heads, but they can positively cheat by using loud alarm calls and throw the cat's chances of catching any others.""<ref name=""Tabor Wild Life""/>{{rp|123}}

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Cats in New Zealand}}

The fauna of [[New Zealand]] has evolved in isolation for millions of years without the presence of mammals (apart from a few bat species). Consequently, birds dominated the niches occupied by mammals and many became flightless. The introduction of mammals after settlement by [[Māori people|Māori]] from about the 12th century had a huge effect on the indigenous [[biodiversity]]. [[Europe]]an explorers and settlers brought cats on their ships and the presence of feral cats were recorded from the latter decades of the 19th century.<ref>King, Carolyn (1984) ''Immigrant Killers''. Auckland: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-558121-0}}</ref>
It is estimated that feral cats have been responsible for the extinction of six endemic bird species and over 70 localised subspecies as well as depleting bird and lizard species.<ref>{{Cite conference | authors = Eason, Charles T.; Morgan, David R. and Clapperton, B.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] states that there is no scientific evidence that cat predation ""is having any impact on bird populations UK-wide. This also means there is no scientific evidence that cat predation is not having an impact of bird populations UK-wide. However the article goes on to say ""This may be surprising, but many millions of birds die naturally every year, mainly through starvation, disease, or other forms of predation. There is evidence that cats tend to take weak or sickly birds"".

 &nbsp;... Those bird species that have undergone the most serious population declines in the UK (such as [[Alauda|skylarks]], [[Eurasian tree sparrow|tree sparrows]] and [[corn bunting]]s) rarely encounter cats, so cats cannot be causing their declines. Research shows that these declines are usually caused by habitat change or loss, particularly on farmland.""<ref name=""Are cats causing bird declines?""/> This evidence is despite the common practice in the U.K. of allowing owned cats access to the outdoors,<ref>""In the UK, the vast majority of pet cats have free access to the outside world, or are at least allowed to go outside unsupervised for large parts of the day."" [http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pet-advice/a-world-of-difference-how-cat-ownership-in-america-differs-to-the-uk.html ""A world of difference – How cat ownership in America differs to the UK""], Pets4Homes, accessed 1 September 2014.</ref> which is recommended to prevent feline obesity (p.&nbsp;138) and behavior problems and other health problems arising from confinement stress (p.&nbsp;121).<ref name=""Tabor Cat Behavior""/>

[[SongBird Survival]] considers that ""The prevailing line that “there is no scientific evidence that predation by cats is having any impact on bird populations in UK” is simply no longer tenable."",<ref>https://www.songbird-survival.org.uk/cats.html</ref> noting ""No study has ever examined the impact of cats on songbirds at the population level; Evidence shows that the recovering sparrowhawk population in the 1970-80s resulted in the decline of some songbird populations; Cats kill around 3 times as many songbirds as sparrowhawks; The mere presence of cats near birds’ nests was found to decrease provision of food by a third while the resultant mobbing clamour from parent birds led in turn to increased nest predation by crows and magpies; [and that] It is therefore far more likely that cats have an even greater impact on songbird populations than sparrowhawks""

[[Sir David Attenborough]] in his Christmas Day edition of [[BBC Radio 4]] programme Tweet Of The Day said """"Cats kill an extraordinarily high number of birds in British gardens,"".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/10/cats-killing-birds-gardens-david-attenborough</ref> Asked whether cat owners should buy bell collars for their pets at Christmas, he replied: ""That would be good for the robins, yes.""

===Islands===

====Consequences of introduction====
[[File:Xenicus lyalli.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lyall's wren]] became extinct within two years of the introduction of cats to [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]].]]

Many islands host [[island tameness|ecologically naive]] animal species. That is, animals that do not have predator responses for dealing with predators such as cats.<ref name=""Moors"">Moors, P.J.; Atkinson, I.A.E. (1984).

Cambridge: ICBP. {{ISBN|0-946888-03-5}}.</ref> Feral cats [[introduced species|introduced]] to such islands have had a devastating impact on these islands' [[biodiversity]].<ref name=""NYT""/>

They have been implicated in the extinction of several species and local extinctions, such as the [[hutia]]s from the [[Caribbean]], the [[Guadalupe storm petrel]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]], and [[Lyall's wren]]. In a statistical study, they were a significant cause for the extinction of 40% of the species studied.<ref name=""NYT"">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/magazine/02cats-v--birds-t.html?em&ex=1196830800&en=4328122ab745ee4d&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Kill the Cat That Kills the Bird? | first=Bruce | last=Barcott | date=2 December 2007}}</ref> Moors and Atkinson wrote, in 1984, ""No other alien predator has had such a universally damaging effect.""<ref name=""Moors""/>

Feral cats, along with rabbits, some sea birds, and [[sheep]], form the entire large animal population of the remote [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern [[Indian Ocean]]. Although exotic mammals form the bulk of their diet, cats' impact on seabirds is very important.<ref name=""Kerguelen"">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00300-002-0424-5 | title=The diet of feral cats (''Felis catus'' L.) at ﬁve sites on the Grande Terre, Kerguelen archipelago | author=Pontier, D., L.

====Restoration====
Because of the damage cats cause in islands and some ecosystems, many conservationists working in the field of [[island restoration]] have worked to remove feral cats. (Island restoration involves the removal of introduced species and reintroducing native species.) As of 2004, 48 islands have had their feral cat populations eradicated, including [[New Zealand]]'s network of offshore island bird reserves<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.issg.org/pdf/publications/Island_Invasives/pdfHQprint/1Campbell.pdf|title=A review of feral cat eradication on islands|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00442.x|year=2004|last1=Nogales|first1=Manuel|last2=Martin|first2=Aurelio|last3=Tershy|first3=Bernie R.|last4=Donlan|first4=C.

Larger projects have also been undertaken, including their complete removal from [[Ascension Island]]. The cats, introduced in the 19th century, caused a collapse in populations of nesting [[seabird]]s. The project to remove them from the island began in 2002, and the island was cleared of cats by 2004. Since then, seven species of seabird that had not nested on the island for 100 years have returned.<ref>[http://petsaspests.blogspot.com/search?q=ascension Cat eradication from Ascension Island]. Petsaspests.blogspot.com (2014-01-23). Retrieved on 2015-11-01.</ref>

In some cases, the removal of cats had unintended consequences. An example is Macquarie Island, where the removal of cats caused an explosion in the number of rabbits, rats, and mice that harm native seabirds<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/up-against-rats-rabbits-and-costs/2007/04/11/1175971183257.html?page=fullpage | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Up against rats, rabbits and costs | date=12 April 2007}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060720104709/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1687413.htm Fears for sub-antarctic island plagued by rabbits].

==Cat evolution==
[[File:Feliform Timeline.svg|right|300px|thumbnail|Feliform evolutionary timeline]]

All modern [[carnivora]]ns, including cats, evolved from [[Miacoidea|miacoids]], which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago. There were other earlier cat-like species but ''[[Proailurus]]'' (meaning ""first cat""; also called ""Leman's Dawn Cat""), which appeared about 30&nbsp;million years ago, is generally considered the first ""true cat"".<ref name=""Hunter"">{{cite book |title=Cats of Africa: Behaviour, Ecology, and Conservation |last=Hunter |first=Luke |authorlink= |author2=Hinde, Gerald |year=2005 |publisher=Struik |location=Cape Town |isbn=1-77007-063-X |pages=40–42 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat }}</ref> 

{{Cquote|Following the appearance of the dawn cat, there is little in the fossil record for 10 million years to suggest that cats would prosper. In fact, although ''Proailurus'' persisted for at least 14&nbsp;million years, there are so few felid fossils towards the end of the dawn cat's reign that paleontologists refer to this as the ""cat gap"". The turning point for cats came about with the appearance of a new genus of felids, ''[[Pseudaelurus]]''<ref name=""Hunter""/>}}

The increase in disparity through the early Miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in North America. The hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 Ma and felids did not arrive in North America until the [[Middle Miocene]] with the appearance of ''Pseudaelurus''. ''Pseudaelurus'' crossed over to North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]] from surviving populations in [[Asia]] 18.5&nbsp;million years ago. All modern-day cats are descended from ''Pseudaelurus''.

Nimravids and barbourofelids were [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed cat-like]] animals of the families [[Nimravidae]] and [[Barbourofelidae]], respectively. Although not ""true cats"" of the family [[Felidae]], they are closely related to felids. The Nimravidae are either basal feliforms or sister group to both feliforms and caniforms, while the [[Barbourofelidae]] are sister group to the Felidae. Physically, some Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae resembled the saber-toothed cat ''[[Smilodon]]'', which would not appear until many millions of years later. Nimravidae also became extinct in North America during the ""cat gap.""<ref name=Joeckela>{{cite journal |author1=R. M. Joeckel |author2=Stephane Peigneb |author3=Robert M. Hunt |author4=Robert I.

==Possible causes==

===Hypercarnivorous tendency===
The history of carnivorous mammals is characterized by a series of rise-and-fall patterns of diversification in which declining [[clades]] are replaced by [[phylogenetic]]ally distinct but functionally similar clades. Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of small and large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline was energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size ([[Cope's rule]]) that lead to [[hypercarnivory]] dietary specialization. Hypercarnivory leads to increased vulnerability to extinction.

The [[nimravid]]s were large cat-like animals that occupied this ecomorphic niche in the [[ecosystem]] until 26 Ma. It is highly likely that their hypercarnivory led to their extinction in North America. After the extinction of the nimravids there were no other feliform or [[Felidae|felid]]-like species until other felids arrived from Eurasia after crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] 18.5 million years ago. During this time there was great diversity among the other carnivorous mammals in North America – both hypocarnivorous and hypercarnivorous species – and other hypercarnivorous species existed before, during, and after the cat gap.

===Changes in climate and habitat===
[[File:Leopard on the tree.jpg|right|thumbnail|Many cats tend to be [[arboreal]] hunters. The disappearance of forests in North America may have caused the mass extinction.]]

Another possible explanation for the extinction of feliforms in North America is [[Ecological succession|changes in the ecology]] of the continent. Evidence from the [[geologic temperature record]] shows that the earth was experiencing a period of [[global cooling]], causing [[forest]]s to give way to [[savanna]]s.<ref name=""Hunter""/> Climatic changes to arid conditions that muted variation at about 25.8 Ma coincides with the first appearance of hoglike [[creodont]]s and of pocket gophers, and this also is the beginning of the ""cat gap"" and the ""[[entelodont]] gap"", a period of some 7 million years when there were no nimravids, felids, or entelodonts in North America. [[Fauna]]l overturn at 25.8 Ma is the basis for division of the [[Miocene|Arikareean]] time period (30.5–19 Ma), and the Arikareen NALMA (North American Land-Mammal Ages), into the [[Monroecreekian]] period (29.5–25.8 Ma), and then the [[Harrisonian]] period (25.8–23.5 Ma).<ref name=Retallack>{{cite journal | author = Gregory J.

{{Cquote|Why did these cat-like creatures die out in North America (while surviving in Eurasia) with no replacement by the true cats? Their fate may be owed to the same factors that created the diversity of herbivorous mammals, for most cats need forest or cover from which to hunt.

Volcanic activity has also been promoted as a possible cause of the cat gap as well as other extinctions during this time period. The [[La Garita Caldera]] is a large volcanic [[caldera]] located in the [[San Juan Mountains]] in southwestern [[Colorado]], United States, and is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive [[ignimbrite]] flare-up in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada during the [[Oligocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|Epoch]]. The La Garita Caldera was the site of the [[Fish Canyon eruption]], an enormous eruption about 27 million years ago. The scale of the Fish Canyon eruption was far beyond anything known in human history (erupting more than {{convert|10000|km3|cumi|abbr=on|disp=or}} for a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 8+ magnitude), and was possibly the most energetic event on Earth since the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]], which is thought by many paleontologists to have caused the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaurs]] in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts of dust and debris into the [[stratosphere]] causing major cooling (see [[volcanic winter]]). Climatic effects could also have been caused by [[sulphur]] ejected into the [[stratosphere]], which rapidly converts to [[sulphuric acid]], an [[aerosol]] which cools the [[troposphere]] by blocking incoming [[solar radiation]].

Another possible cause of the cat gap could have been the late Cenozoic [[Timeline of glaciation|ice age]] that began approximately 30 million years ago. This ice age caused [[glaciation]] in [[Antarctica]] that eventually spread to [[Arctic]] regions of southern [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]], and [[Iceland]]. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather [[caniformia]] species such as [[canids]] (dog-like species), [[mustelids]] (weasel-like species), and [[ursids]] (bear-like species).

{{Cquote|There is also evidence that during the Miocene a sill surrounding the Arctic Ocean, known as the Greenland–Scotland Ridge, subsided, allowing more cold polar water to escape into the North Atlantic. As the salinity of the North Atlantic grew and as outflow of cold polar water increased, so the [[thermohaline circulation]] increased in vigour, providing the mild winter temperatures and large amounts of moisture to the North Atlantic, which are prerequisites to the build-up of the large continental ice caps on the adjacent cold continents.<ref name=""Haggart"">{{cite book |chapter=Ice-age Theories |title=The Oxford Companion to the Earth |last=Haggart |first=B.

==Evolution of caniforms during the gap==
[[File:Amphicyonidae_illustration.png|right|thumbnail|Some paleontologists argue that caniforms like [[Amphicyonidae]] - ""bear dogs"" - responded to the cat gap by evolving to become more cat-like, to fill the [[hypercarnivore]] [[ecological niche]]<ref name=""Valkenburgh""/>]]

It has been suggested by some that as a result of the cat gap [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (dog-like species including canids, bears, weasels, and other related taxa) evolved to fill more carnivorous and [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] [[ecological niche]]s that would otherwise have been filled by cats.<ref name=""Valkenburgh""/> This conclusion, however, is disputed.<ref name=Hunt>{{cite journal |author = Gina D.

{{Cquote|During or just prior to this ""cat gap,"" numerous caniform species evolve catlike features indicative of hypercarnivory, such as reduced snouts, somewhat enlarged canines, and fairly extreme reduction of their crushing [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s. In North America the first caniform group of moderate body size to move in the direction of hypercarnivory were the [[endemic]] [[Hesperocyoninae|hesperocyonine]] canids, with three genera (''[[Parenhydrocyon]]'', ''[[Enhydrocyon]]'', and ''[[Mesocyon]]''), ranging in size from jackals to small coyotes, appearing in the early [[Arikareean]] (circa 28 MYA). Notably, these three evolved alongside the last [[hyaenodont]] and the remaining three nimravids, two of which were [[Cougar|puma]]-sized. The small hypercarnivorous canids were soon joined by and ultimately replaced by numerous species from other families which also had evolved more specialized meat-eating teeth and skulls. These included at least three larger genera of similarly adapted [[amphicyonid]]s, one endemic (''[[Daphoenodon]]'') and two from the Old World (''[[Temnocyon]]'' and ''[[Mammocyon]]''), a leopard-sized [[Mustelidae|mustelid]] (''[[Megalictis]]'') as well as two hypercarnivorous bears, the [[hemicyonine]]s ''[[Cephalogale]]'' and ''[[Phoberocyon]]''.<ref name=Valkenburgh>{{cite journal |last=Van Valkenburgh |first=Blaire |year=1999 |title=Major Patterns in the History of Carnivorous Mammals |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=463–493 | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463?journalCode=earth |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463 | accessdate=2008-11-28 |quote= }}</ref>}}

However, other paleontologists take issue with this conclusions:

{{Cquote|It has been suggested that canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies because feliforms were absent during this period (the ‘cat-gap’’, 26–16 Ma). The data presented here do not support this hypothesis. In the calculated [[morphospace]]... Canids never occupy the area of morphospace in which felids, nimravids, and hypercarnivorous [[creodont]]s are found. More pertinent to the issue at hand, however, is that most of these hypercarnivorous canids were present before the disappearance of the nimravids, and all became extinct before the appearance of felids....There was a progressive and marked decrease in hypercarnivorous forms during the ‘‘cat-gap.’’ 28–20 Ma are characterized by above average extinction intensities and below average origination intensities. 20 Ma was marked by an increase in origination intensity, and 18 Ma showed a decrease in extinction intensity and a large increase in origination intensity. Nonetheless, despite increased origination intensities and decreased extinction intensities near the end of the ‘‘cat-gap’’ (20–16 Ma), there was still no substantial invasion of hypercarnivorous morphospace until the immigration of felids into North America.""<ref name=""Hunt"" />}}

{{merge to|Felidae|discuss=Talk:Felidae#Merger proposal|date=September 2016}}A '''pet exotic feline''', also called '''pet wild cat''' or '''pet non-domestic cat''', is a member of the [[Felidae]] family (excluding the [[Cat|house cat]] and hybrids thereof) kept as an [[exotic pet]].

== Definition and differentiations ==
Hybrids of the domestic cat with non-domestic species (e. g. the [[Bengal cat]] or the [[Savannah cat]]) are not normally considered '''wild cats'''. While this distinction is often overlooked in the media and in the public eye, such cat breeds (especially the F5 and subsequent generations) are much closer to the domestic cat in terms of housing and husbandry requirements, behavior, and legality.

Unlike many other exotic pet species, wild cats usually cannot be kept indoors and require a large outdoor enclosure. This blurs the distinction between a wild cat being kept as an exotic pet and a private animal collection or menagerie. Usually, an enclosure meant for a pet exotic cat is built adjacent to the house in order to give the animal access into the living quarters.

[[Lion taming|Tame big cats]] kept by [[Animal training|animal trainers]] (e. g. in circuses, private zoos or the film animal industry) are commonly mistaken for exotic pets. While the husbandry conditions and handling might be similar to a purely private setting, the common definition of a [[pet]] only includes animals kept for companionship or pleasure. Professional holders, breeders, or exhibitors do not meet this definition.

== History ==
Exotic felines have a long tradition in human care. The ancient Egyptians kept servals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.domesticatedservals.com/|title=Domesticated Servals|website=www.domesticatedservals.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> in the same role as the African Wildcat (the wild ancestor of modern house cats). [[Cheetah]]s have also been kept throughout the world, both as companions and as hunting aides.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cheetahs-rock.de/index-englisch.htm|title=Cheetah's Rock|website=www.cheetahs-rock.de|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> Caracals have also been tamed and trained, primarily by Arabian and Asian rulers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caracal-rock.com/index-englisch.htm|title=Caracal Rock|website=www.caracal-rock.com|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> Other large cats sometimes were also kept as companions, but were mostly limited to menageries owned by royal families.

== Species kept as exotic pets ==
In general, small cat species are more commonly kept as exotic pets than larger ones. [[Big cat]]s are substantially more expensive to maintain, pose a greater danger when being handled in direct contact, and may not always remain handleable when fully grown. This typically limits their keeping to professional animal trainers and zoo settings.

=== Servals and caracals ===
[[Serval]]s and [[caracal]]s have the longest history as human companions. Part of their popularity can be attributed to the fact that they readily hybridize with domestic cats. The resulting crosses ([[Savannah cat|savannahs]] and caracats) inherit traits of both the domestic cat and the wild species. <ref> https://caracats.wordpress.com/ </ref>

=== Lynxes and bobcats ===
Nearly all species of the [[Lynx]] genus (with the exception of the Iberian lynx) are kept as exotic pets. Unlike other small cat species, they are not known to hybridize with the domestic cat.

=== Ocelots ===
This species enjoyed some popularity as an exotic pet in the 50s and 60s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://allaboutocelots.wordpress.com/2015/12/25/ocelots-as-pets/|title=Ocelots as pets|date=2015-12-25|website=all about ocelots|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> The passage of the Endangered Species Act in the USA effectively ended their keeping outside of zoological facilities due to interstate animal movement restrictions. Their popularity is also limited by their comparatively high aggression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phoenixexotics.org/caresheet/ocelot|title=Care Sheet - Ocelot {{!}} Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association|website=www.phoenixexotics.org|access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> No hybrids with domestic cats are known.

=== Pumas ===
While being considered small cats taxonomically, pumas are comparable in size to some of the big cats. They are typically less aggressive and more affectionate than big cats, which has led to some popularity as exotic pets.

=== Cheetahs ===
The cheetah has a long history as a human companion. However, difficulties in breeding prevented this species from becoming a widespread exotic pet in modern times.

Praised for controlling vermin and its ability to kill snakes such as [[cobra]]s, the domesticated cat became a symbol of grace and poise. 

As domestication was not as steadfast with cats as today, wealthy families would often curate examples of well bred felines, show them, and pride themselves in the coloration and behavioural adaptations that are seen in today's organized shows.

The goddess [[Mafdet]], the deification of [[justice]] and [[capital punishment|execution]], was a lion-headed goddess. The cat goddess [[Bastet|Bast]] (also known as ''Bastet'') eventually replaced Mafdet, and Bast's image softened over time and she became the deity representing protection, [[fertility]], and [[mother]]hood.

As a revered animal and one important to Egyptian society and religion, some cats  [[cat mummies|received the same mummification after death]] as humans. Mummified cats were given in offering to Bast.{{cnl|reason=cannot find backing evidence for this|date=March 2011}} In 1888, an Egyptian farmer uncovered a large tomb with mummified cats and kittens. This discovery outside the town of [[Beni Hasan]] had eighty thousand [[cat mummies]], dated after 1000 BC.{{Cnl|date=October 2015}} The punishments for harming cats were severe.

[[File:Cat with Kittens, ca. 664-30 B.C.E. or later.jpg|thumb|right|'''''Cat with Kittens'', c. 664-30 BC or later. Bronze, wood.'''

The base of the statuette of Cat with Kittens is inscribed with a request that Bastet grant life, directly linking the cat pictured here with the goddess Bastet. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

Cats were one of the most recognizable species in Egyptian culture and were domesticated much later than dogs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Two types of smaller cats appeared in ancient Egypt: the jungle cat (''Felis chaus'') and the African wild cat (''Felis silvestris libyca''). The African wild cat was domesticated from the Predynastic Period onward.<ref>[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg,Edward]] ''Soulful Creatures: Animal Mummies in Ancient Egypt'', Brooklyn Museum (2013).</ref> Wild cats naturally preyed upon the rats and other vermin that ate from the royal [[granary|granaries]]. They earned their place in towns and cities by killing mice, venomous [[snake]]s, and other pests.  They were worshipped by the Egyptians and given jewelry in hieroglyphics.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Small cats would often be found underneath women's chairs on reliefs, evoking fertility and sexuality. The other variety of cat, the lion, was also prevalent in Egyptian culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Although most [[lion]]s receded to the south around the Predynastic Period, lions were rare in pharaonic times, but were extremely important in Egyptian iconography. Lions represented royal authority because of their aggressive nature and power.<ref>[[Edward Bleiberg|Bleiberg]], ''Soulful Creatures''</ref>

== Cats in Egyptian religion ==
[[File:Ancient Egyptian bronze statue of a reclining cat and kitten.jpg|left|thumb|A [[bronze]] statue of a domesticated cat and her kitten]]

The earliest evidence of felines as deities comes from a {{circa}} 3100 BC crystal cup decorated with an image of the cat-headed goddess [[Mafdet]]. The goddess [[Bastet]] was originally depicted as a fiercely protective and warlike [[lion]]ess, like [[Sekhmet]], but as Bastet's image ""softened"" over time, she became more strongly associated with domestic cats.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

As cats were sacred to Bast, the practice of [[mummy|mummification]] was extended to them,{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} and the respect that cats received after death mirrored the respect with which they were treated in everyday life. The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that in the event of a fire, men would guard the fire to make certain that no cats ran into the flame. Herodotus also wrote that when a cat died, the household would go into mourning as if for a human relative, and would often shave their eyebrows to signify their loss.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KdUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA308|title=All the Year Round|first=Charles|last=Dickens|year=1862|page=308|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Diodorus Siculus]], describes an interesting example of swift justice imposed upon the killer of a cat: about 60 BC, he witnessed a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] accidentally kill an Egyptian cat. An outraged mob gathered and, despite pleas from pharaoh [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], killed the Roman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sXiMtMnPHikC&pg=PA39|title=Diodorus Siculus, Book 1|publisher=|page=39|first=Anne |last=Burton|year=1973}}</ref>

== Bubastis and the cult of the cat ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}
[[File:Egyptian - Statue of a Seated Cat - Walters 54403 - Three Quarter.jpg|left|thumb|This seated cat has golden earrings, a golden scarab inlaid on the forehead, and a necklace with a pendant in low relief.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/35906 |title= Statue of a Seated Cat}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]

Although the cat cult was a religious movement by the beginning of the [[New Kingdom]], it gained importance when [[Shoshenq I]] (c. 943–922 BC) developed [[Bubastis]], chief centre of worship for the goddess Bast, located east of the [[Nile Delta]], into an important city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} At the same time, Bast developed into an immensely popular and important deity representing fertility, motherhood, protection, and the benevolent aspects of the sun – along with [[Sekhmet]], she was known as the [[Eye of Ra]]. The cult of the cat garnered a huge following, and thousands of pilgrims journeyed each year to Bubastis to celebrate. ''Bubastis'' also became another name by which the goddess was known.

Close to the centre of the city lay a large temple to Bast. This temple was in a depression, and thus at a lower elevation than the rest of the city that had been raised to minimize flood damage from the nearby Nile. Herodotus, who visited the city in 450 BC, wrote that although the size of the shrine to Bast was perhaps ""not as large as those of other cities, and probably not as costly, no temple in all of Egypt gave more pleasure to the eye.""

Herodotus went on to describe the temple in detail. A canal within this depression gave the temple the appearance of a man-made island. In the courtyard was a grove of trees leading the way to the interior, containing a massive statue of Bast, and a great number of sacred cats, cared for by the temple priests with donations from pilgrims. The temple's cat population, while respected, was extremely large, and needed to be moderated by the periodic sacrificial culling of kittens, which were then mummified and sold to pilgrims as [[relic]]s.

Bubastis became a marketplace for merchants of all sorts; artisans came forth with thousands of bronze sculptures and [[amulet]]s depicting cats to worshippers of Bast. These amulets commonly featured an image of a cat and its kittens, and were often used by women trying to have children, praying to Bast, or Bastet that they be granted the same number of children as kittens depicted on the amulet.

Herodotus wrote that the annual festival of Bast held in the city was one of the most popular of all, with attendees from all over Egypt, who would raft down the Nile celebrating and feasting all the way. When they arrived in Bubastis, they feasted yet more and made sacrifices to Bast.

<!-- By 525 BC, Egypt was essentially the only empire not conquered by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. At that point [[Cambyses II of Persia|Cambyses]], the son of [[Cyrus the Great]], set out to do just that.  Cambyses and his army crossed the fifty-six mile stretch of desert to the Egyptian outpost of Pelesium on camelback; they then clashed down upon the Egyptian army who were reluctant to strike back at the sacred symbol of the cat upon the Persian shields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} -->

[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]
{{See also|Cat mummies}}
Herodotus noted that cats that died anywhere in Egypt were often taken to Bubastis to be [[Mummy|mummified]] and buried in the great [[cemetery]], but this may or may not have been the case. At the burial site in Bubastis the Swiss [[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]] [[Édouard Naville]] found more than 20 m<sup>3</sup> (720 cubic feet) of cat remains but also a great deal of evidence of [[cremation]]. Naville found stacks of cat bones in many pits, the walls of which were made up of bricks and clay. Near each pit lay a furnace, its bricks blackened from fire. This discovery causes some problems. The mummification and preservation of the body was intended to make it possible for the deceased's ''[[Egyptian soul|ka]]'' to locate its host and subsequently be reborn into the [[afterlife]]. As the body would have to be intact for this process to occur, cremation would seem an undesirable way of dealing with the body of a sacred creature with a ''ka''. Nevertheless, many cats were afforded the full embalming ceremony and buried in other great cemeteries along the Nile.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In her book ''The Cult of the Cat'', Patricia Dale-Green states that, ""The cat's body was placed in a [[linen]] sheet and carried amidst bitter lamentations by the bereaved to a sacred house where it was treated with drugs and spices by an embalmer.""<ref name=Dale-Green>{{cite book | title=The Cult of the Cat | publisher=Weathervane Books | author=Patricia Dale-Green | year=1963 | isbn=9780517175002 | chapter=The White Cat}}</ref>{{rp|17}}
She goes on to state that although the cat of an Egyptian noble would receive more extravagant burial status, the body of a worker's cat would still be carefully prepared and the embalming carried out with the same conscientiousness as for a human body, often with provisions for the afterlife such as pots of milk and even mummified mice.<ref name=Dale-Green/>{{rp|18}}

Nowhere, perhaps, is this appreciation shown more than in the colossal tomb at the temple of Bast discovered in 1888. This tomb, outside of [[Beni Hasan]], held more than nineteen tonnes of animal mummies and remains, the vast majority being cats but a number of [[mongoose]]s, dogs, and [[fox]]es were amongst the specimens that made it to the [[British Museum]]. The farmer who made the discovery sold most of the tomb's contents to be ground up as fertilizer, but a number of specimens made it into the hands of scientists for testing and examination. Some of these are on display at the British Museum.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|William Martin Conway]] wrote: ""The plundering of the cemetery was a sight to see, but one had to stand well windward. The village children came from day to day and provided themselves with the most attractive mummies they could find. These they took down the river bank to sell for the smallest coin to passing travelers.  The path became strewn with mummy cloth and bits of cats' skulls and bones and fur in horrid positions, and the wind blew the fragments about and carried the stink afar.""<ref>Conway, M. 1891. The Dawn of Art in the Ancient World. Macmillan and Co., New York.</ref>

During the making of his documentary for the BBC, ''Cats: The Rise of the Cat'', Roger Tabor discovered a further cat cemetery at Bast's temple. This find consists of a twenty centimetre-thick layer of compressed mummies which spans more than sixty metres in length.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

== Decline of cat-worship ==
The cult of Bast was officially banned by imperial decree in 390 AD. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Egypt has since experienced a decline in the respect once held for cats; they are still kept as pets and tolerated elsewhere because they catch pests. Even so, the cat has not lost all religious significance with modern Egypt's largely Islamic population, since cats are also [[Cats and Islam|revered to some extent in Muslim tradition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |title=Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 40: Distribution of Water |work=usc.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309200330/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/040.sbt.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=3207|title=Cats and Islam|work=The Muslim Observer}}</ref>

'''Cat senses''' are [[adaptation]]s that allow [[cat]]s to be highly efficient [[predator]]s. Cats have acute sight, hearing and smell, and their sense of touch is enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their heads and bodies. These senses allow cats to hunt effectively in dim light and at night.

==Sight==
[[Image:Reflektion des Auges.JPG|thumb|left|The tapetum lucidum reflecting green in the pupils of a cat]]
Cats, like dogs and many other animals, have a ''[[tapetum lucidum]]'', which is a reflective layer behind the [[retina]] that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Braekevelt CR |title=Fine structure of the feline tapetum lucidum |journal=Anat Histol Embryol |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=97–105 |year=1990 |pmid=2240589 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0264.1990.tb00892.x}}</ref> While this improves the ability to see in darkness, it appears to reduce net [[visual acuity]], thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like [[pupil]] closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive [[retina]], and improving [[depth of field]]. [[Big cat]]s have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.
[[Image:Cats Eye 004.jpg|200px|thumb|A closeup of a cat's eye]]
Cats have a visual [[field of view]] of  200° compared with 180° in humans, but a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans. As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording [[depth perception]] at the expense of field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction.

Cats have a second eyelid, the [[nictitating membrane]], which is a thin cover that closes from the side and appears when the cat's eyelid opens. This membrane partially closes if the cat is sick, although in a sleepy state this membrane is often visible.

Cats struggle to see still water, and will often disrupt the surface with their paws or lick water off their paws.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Cats often sleep during the day so they can ""hunt"" at night. Unlike humans, cats do not need to [[blink]] their eyes on a regular basis to keep their eyes lubricated (with [[tears]]). Unblinking eyes are probably an advantage when hunting. Cats will, however, ""squint"" their eyes, usually as a form of communication expressing affection and ease around another cat or human.<ref name=""webmd cats"">{{Cite web|url=http://pets.webmd.com/cats/features/cat-body-language|title=What Your Cat's Body Language Is Saying|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>

==Hearing==
Humans and cats have a similar range of hearing on the low end of the scale, but cats can hear much higher-pitched sounds, up to 64 [[Hertz|kHz]], which is 1.6 octaves above the range of a human, and even 1 octave above the range of a dog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/deafness/HearingRange.html|title=Frequency Hearing Ranges in Dogs and Other Species|publisher=}}</ref> When listening for something, a cat's ears will swivel in that direction; a cat's ear flaps ([[pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]) can independently point backwards as well as forwards and sideways to pinpoint the source of the [[sound]]. Cats can judge within {{convert|3|in|spell=in}} the location of a sound being made {{convert|1|yd|cm|spell=in}} away{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}—this can be useful for locating their prey.

Although it was long generally thought that cats were unresponsive to music, recent studies have shown that they do in fact respond to music which has been created with species-specific frequencies. Results suggested that cats do benefit from music therapy when the sounds have been composed to target their auditory senses. Other findings include age-related sensitivity (older and younger cats were more responsive than middle aged cats).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Teie|first2=David|last3=Savage|first3=Megan|date=2015-05-01|title=Cats prefer species-appropriate music|url=http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(15)00060-X/fulltext|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|language=English|volume=166|pages=106–111|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2015.02.012|issn=0168-1591}}</ref>

==Smell==
A domestic cat's [[olfaction|sense of smell]] is about fourteen times as strong as humans'.{{dubious|About.com source on cat/human olfactory comparison|date=December 2016}}<ref name=""sense of smell"">{{cite web | url=http://cats.about.com/cs/felineanatomy/a/catsnose_scent.htm | title=The Nose Knows | publisher=About.com | accessdate=29 November 2006}}</ref> Cats have twice as many receptors<ref>{{cite book|last1=Purves|first1=Dale|last2=Augustine|first2=George J.|last3=Fitzpatrick|first3=David|last4=Hall|first4=William C.|last5=LaMantia|first5=Anthony-Samuel|last6=White|first6=Leonard E.|title=Neuroscience|date=2001-01-15|publisher=Sinauer Associates|isbn=9780878937424|edition=2nd|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11032/|accessdate=25 December 2016}}</ref> in the [[olfactory epithelium]] (i.e. smell-sensitive cells in their noses) as people do, meaning that cats have a more acute sense of smell than humans. Cats also have a scent organ in the roof of their mouths called the [[vomeronasal organ|vomeronasal]] (or Jacobson's) organ. When a cat wrinkles its muzzle, lowers its chin, and lets its tongue hang a bit, it is opening the passage to the vomeronasal. This is called ''gaping'', ""sneering"", ""snake mouth"", or ""flehming"". Gaping is the equivalent of the [[Flehmen response]] in other animals, such as [[dog]]s, [[horse]]s and [[big cat]]s.

==Touch==
[[Image:Tuxedo kitten.jpg|thumb|Whiskers on the face of a [[Bicolor cat#Tuxedo cats|tuxedo kitten]].]]

A cat has about twenty-four movable [[vibrissae]] (""whiskers""), in four sets on each upper lip on either side of its nose (some cats may have more). There are also a few on each cheek, tufts over the eyes, bristles on the chin, the cat's inner ""wrists"", and at the back of the legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moggies.co.uk/html/whiskers.html|title=Cat's Whiskers|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx]] (a nearly hairless breed) may have full length, short, or no whiskers at all.

The structure of the brain region ([[barrel cortex]]) which receives information from the vibrissae is similar to that found in the [[visual cortex]] which permits the cat to create a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] map of its surroundings. This doesn't mean that sensing with vibrissae is a type of vision. It is still a touch sensation and environmental information is built up incrementally (in small steps).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Dykes RW, Dudar JD, Tanji DG, Publicover NG |title=Somatotopic projections of mystacial vibrissae on cerebral cortex of cats |journal=J.

Vibrissae aid sensation and [[navigation]]. The upper two rows of whiskers are able to be moved independently from the lower two rows for greater [[accuracy and precision|precision]] during measurement. A cat's whiskers are more than twice as thick as ordinary cat hairs, and their roots are three times deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous [[nerve]] endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat to know that it is near obstacles without it needing to see them.

Whiskers also aid in hunting. [[High speed photography]] reveals that when a cat is unable to see its prey because it is too close to its mouth, its whiskers move so as to form a basket shape around its [[snout|muzzle]] in order to precisely detect the prey's location.<ref>[http://www.floridaconservation.org/panther/handbook/natural/relation.html Cat Traits] Floridaconservation.org</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Mel Sunquist |author2=Sunquist, Fiona |author3=Sunquist, Melvin E. |title=Wild cats of the world |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2002 |isbn=0-226-77999-8 }}</ref> A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the wrong part of its prey, indicating that they provide cats with detailed information about the shape and activity of its prey.[[Image:DSC 0003 - Version 3.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Whiskers also aid in hunting]]

==Taste==
The [[Felidae|cat family]] was shown in 2005 to lack the [[TAS1R2]] [[protein]], one of two required for function of the [[sweetness]] [[sensory receptor]]; a [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] in the relevant [[gene]] (''Tas1r2'') causes a shift in the genetic [[reading frame]], leading to [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] stopping early and no detectable [[mRNA]] or protein produced.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Li X |title=Pseudogenization of a Sweet-Receptor Gene Accounts for Cats' Indifference toward Sugar |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=27–35 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16103917 |pmc=1183522 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010003 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.0010003 |author2=Li W |author3=Wang H |display-authors=3 |last4=Cao |first4=Jie |last5=Maehashi |first5=Kenji |last6=Huang |first6=Liquan |last7=Bachmanov |first7=Alexander A. |last8=Reed |first8=Danielle R. |last9=Legrand-Defretin |first9=Véronique}}</ref>
The other protein, [[T1R3|TAS1R3]], is present and identical to that of other animals, and the relevant [[taste bud]]s are still present but inactive. Such a [[genetic marker]] found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a [[mutation]] in an early ancestor; as a [[deletion mutation]] it could not [[Evolutionary biology|revert]], and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the [[evolutionary tree]] branched out. Some scientists now believe this is the root of the cat family's extremely specialized [[evolution]]ary [[ecological niche|niche]] as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.

[[Image:Neighbours Siamese.jpg|thumb|A cat with a point coloration.]]
'''Point coloration''' refers to animal coat coloration with a pale body and relatively darker extremities, i.e. the face, ears, feet, tail, and (in males) [[scrotum]]. It is most recognized as the coloration of [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and related breeds of [[cat]], but can be found in [[rabbit]]s, [[fancy rat|rats]], [[sheep]], and [[horse]]s as well.

[[File:PhaithaiChic Thai cat.jpg|thumb|A [[Thai cat]] with point coloration]]
Point coloration in cats originated in the [[Siamese cat|Siamese]] and closely related Asian breeds, and is found in many Western-developed modern breeds. It is a form of partial [[albinism]] resulting from a [[mutation]] that affects [[tyrosinase]], an enzyme involved with [[melanin]] production. The mutated enzyme is [[thermolabile]]; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler areas of the skin.<ref>{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}</ref> As a result, dark pigment is limited to the coldest areas of the body, that is, the extremities. Pointed [[kitten]]s are born white, since the womb is uniformly warm. As the kitten ages, the cooler areas darken while warmer areas remain cream to white in color. Points are not limited to solid colors or dark colors. It is possible to have a red (orange color) or fawn (pale warm gray) point. It is also possible to have a [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] or [[tabby]] point. This coloration is also sometimes called ''colorpoints''.

As the expression of the gene responsible for the pointed pattern is regulated by temperature, pointed cats who live in cooler environments often show darkening of their fur, with large patches along their sides sometimes developing.

Because of this restriction of pigment, pointed cat's eyes are always some shade of blue, because the top layer of the iris is not covered in another color, letting the blue show through. The back of the eye also lacks pigment, giving these cats' pupils an eerie red reflection in the dark, unlike a normally pigmented cat's green to blue shine.

The [[Cat coat genetics|point gene]] is carried on the C [[Locus (genetics)|locus]], where pure [[albinism]] is also carried. It is shown with the sign '''cs''', and needs two alleles of cs for the points to be expressed. Also carried on the C locus is the gene for the [[sepia pattern]]. This is the darkest of all of the pigment restricting patterns, and pigment is only paled at the warmest point in the body, the abdomen. This pattern's gene is represented by '''cb'''. When a cat carries the genes cs and cb, the [[mink pattern]] is formed, in which the pigment distribution is between a sepia and a point cat.

{{anchor|Lynx point|lynx point|lynx point (coloration)}}
The ''lynx point'' pattern is formed by cross-breeding a colorpoint cat with a [[tabby cat]] (or breeding cats that already possess the lynx point pattern). It is characterized by a mixture of the darkening (reduced) of point coloration, with distinct tabby striping on the head, tail, and legs, and an otherwise uniform and comparatively pale body. It is an accepted pattern, in some cat registries but not others, for particular breeds, mostly Siamese-related.<ref>Exactly which registries accept lynx-point coloration, or other point coloration, at any given time is a moving target, best checked with awards searches at particular registries, e.g. a [http://www.tica.org/search?searchword=lynx%20point&ordering=newest&searchphrase=all&limit=20 search for ""lynx point"" at the TICA website].</ref> Lynx point coloration was also a feature of some of the [[foundation stock]] of the [[Siberian cat|Siberian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tica.org/find-a-breeder/item/269-siberian-introduction|title=Siberian Introduction|first=|last=TICA|publisher=}}</ref>

[[File:He012002 1.jpg|thumb|left|White markings or other genetic factors may partially or completely mask point coloration in horses.]]
In horses, point coloration is produced by the action of the [[Agouti signalling peptide|Agouti]] gene, which acts on the [[Melanocortin 1 receptor|extension gene]], when present, to suppress black color to all but the extremities of the horse; the legs, mane, tail and tips of the ears.  If the extension gene is not present, the effect of agouti is not visible, as there is no black color present to suppress.  Points are most typically seen on a [[bay (horse)|bay]]-colored horse, which has a black mane, tail, legs and ear tips while the body and head will show the underlying [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] or ""red"" base color. Point coloration may also be visible on horses with [[dilution gene]]s that act upon a bay base coat such as the [[dun gene]] and a single copy of the [[cream gene]].  Other genes or [[horse markings|white markings]] may affect a horse's coat color in addition to agouti, and if present, can further alter or suppress black hair color and may mask any point coloration.  Any [[horse breed]] may have point coloration with the exception of a very small number of [[horse breed]]s where humans have specifically used [[selective breeding]] to eliminate the agouti gene.

==In rabbits==
The classic, pointed white rabbit, as seen in the Himalayan rabbit breed, is created by the ch gene. Sable points, Seal points, Blue Points, Chocolate Points, Lilac Points, Siamese, Pearl, and Sallander do not have the ch gene, which can be seen because they lack the red eyes of true pointed white rabbits. Those colors are created by the cchl, cchd, or cchm gene in conjunction with the e gene. Pointed White rabbits were first seen in the Himalayan breed, and are now seen in the Californian breed, but are accepted varieties in many breeds, including the French Angora, English Angora, Satin Angora, Jersey Wooly, Netherland Dwarf, Holland Lop, Mini Rex, Rex, Satin, Mini Lop, and American Fuzzy Lop, and it is a color in development in Mini Satins. No pointed white Rabbit can produce orange pigment, the points are always black, blue, chocolate or lilac, sometimes in conjunction with white agouti, marten, broken, Vienna, or harlequin patterns, but these are not colors recognized for showing. All pointed white rabbits have red eyes.

'''Feline zoonosis''' are the [[virus|viral]], [[pathogenic bacteria|bacterial]], [[fungus|fungal]], [[protozoan]], [[nematode]] and [[arthropod]] [[infection]]s that can be transmitted to humans from the domesticated [[cat]], ''Felis catus''. Some of these are diseases are reemerging and newly emerging infections or infestations caused by zoonotic pathogens transmitted by cats. In some instances, the cat can display symptoms of infection (these may differ from the symptoms in humans) and sometimes the cat remains asymptomatic. There can be serious illnesses and clinical manifestations in people who become infected. This dependent on their immune status and age. Those who live in close association with cats are more prone to these infections. But those that do not keep cats as pets are also able to acquire these infections because of the transmission can be from cat feces and the parasites that leave their bodies.<ref name=""Chomel2014"">{{cite journal|last1=Chomel|first1=Bruno|title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats|journal=Animals|volume=4|issue=3|year=2014|pages=434–445|issn=2076-2615|doi=10.3390/ani4030434|PMID=26480316|pmc=4494318}}</ref>

People can acquire cat-associated infections through bites, scratches or other direct contact of the skin or mucous membranes with the cat. This includes ‘kissing’ or letting the animal lick the mouth or nose. Mucous membranes are easily infected when the pathogen is in the mouth of the cat. Pathogens can also infect people when there is contact with animal saliva, urine and other body fluids or secretions, When fecal material is unintentionally ingested, infection can occur. Feline zooinosis can be acquired by a person by inhalation of aerosols or droplets coughed up by the cat.<ref name=""StullBrophy2015"">{{cite journal|last1=Stull|first1=J.

==Viral==
[[File:Cowpox eruption.jpg|thumb|left|Cowpox infection]]

In 2010, over 400 cases of [[cowpox infection]] from cats to human have been described. The symptoms differ between both humans and cats. In people, local exanthema appears on the arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are [[immunosuppressed]] can progress to [[systematic infection]] that closely resembles [[smallpox]]. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of cowpox infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a [[purulent discharge]] from the eyes. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of cowpox are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom.<ref name=""Chomel2014""/>

Different strains of the [[tuberculosis]] bacterium  (''[[Mycobacterium bovis]], [[M. tuberculosis]] and [[M. microti]]'') have been isolated from cats and associated with infection with the presence of the bacterium in their owners, but a definitive cause has not been established. Neither has one strain of [[influenza]] been proven to infect pet owners, though infected cats can [[Contagious disease| infect]] other cats.<ref name=""Chomel2014""/>

===Kennel Cough===
[[Bordetella bronchiseptica]] has been identified in cats with owners that also are infected with this pathogen. Individuals having this infection have usually been cancer or transplant patients. Those with this infection can develop serious pneumonia.<ref name = Chomel2014/>

==Echinococcosis==
[[Echinococcus multilocularis]]  can infect cats and then trasmitted to their owners to cause [[human alveolar echinococcosis]]. Foxes have transmitted this pathogen to cats in Germany, Austria, France and Japan.<ref name = Chomel2014/>

==Arthropods==
[[Cheyletiellosis]] (also known as Cheyletiella dermatitis) is a mild, short-term skin inflammation caused by the mite ''[[Cheyletiella blakei]]'' that feeds on a person's skin cells. It is spread through contact with infested cats. Though not a common ectoparasite, it may be an emerging pathogen in California. The infected cat may have no signs of infection. However, affected kittens may have patches of scaly skin with dandruff. The most common symptoms of cheyletiellosis in people include itching, redness, and raised bumps on areas of the skin that touched the infested animal.  Cheyletiellosis in people generally resolves on its own.<ref name=CDCcats2016/><ref name=""SchullerFrancey2015""/>

==Fungi==
Cats are reservoirs and are able to transmit mycotic infections.<ref>{{cite book |last=McPhee |first=Stephen |title=Current medical diagnosis & treatment 2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=9780071763721 |page=110}}</ref>  Cats, especially kittens can pass on a [[Ringworm]] infection to people. Ringworm is a fungal disease and approximately 40 types of fungi can cause ringworm. They are typically of the ''[[Trichophyton]]'', ''[[Microsporum]]'', or ''[[Epidermophyton]]'' type.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/ringworm/definition.html|title=Definition of Ringworm | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = April 30, 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}{{CDC}}</ref>  It gets its name from the characteristic ring-like [[rash]] on the skin. The disease is spread by touching an infected cat. The rash may be scaly, reddened, and circular. Ringworm on the scalp usually makes a bald patch of scaly skin. Long-haired  cats do not always show signs of ringworm infection. Kittens with ringworm have patches that are hairless, circular, or irregularly shaped areas of scaling, crusting, and redness that may or may not be itchy. The area may not be completely hairless, and instead have brittle, broken hairs. If the claws are affected, they may have a whitish, opaque appearance with shredding of the claw's surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/ringworm.html|title=Ringworm - Healthy Pets Healthy People | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = April 30, 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017}}{{CDC}}</ref>

[[Sporotrichosis]] is a fungal disease that is transmitted by mostly outdoor cats.<ref name = Chomel2014/>

==Platyhelminthes==
[[File:Paragonimus westermani 01.jpg|thumb|The lung fluke ''Paragonimus westermani'']]

Paragonimiasis, or [[lung fluke]] uses cats as a reservoir and subsequently can transmit the infection to humans. Symptoms in cats have not been observed. There are over nine species of lung flukes that can be transmitted to humans from cats. The disease has been found in Asia, Africa, India, North, South and Central America. It is not uncommon and estimates of those infected are in the millions. Signs symptoms in humans are [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], migration of the flukes into other body organs including the central nervous system. There it can cause neurological symptoms such as [[headache]], confusion, [[convulsion]]s, vision problems, and [[stroke|bleeding in the brain]]. This infection in humans is sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis.{{sfn|Heymann|pages=443-445}}

[[Onchocercosis]] has been associated with pet cats in a few cases.<ref name = Chomel2014/>

Cats can harbor and transmit hookworms to people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/animals.html|title= Parasites - Animals (Zoonotic)|accessdate=19 June 2017 | date = |publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention }}{{CDC}}</ref>

==Protozoans==
[[Cryptosporidiosis]] is a parasitic disease that is transmitted through contaminated food or water from an infected person or animal. Cryptosporidiosis in cats is rare, but they can carry the [[protozoan]] without showing any signs of illness. Cryptosporidiosis can cause profuse, watery diarrhea with cramping, abdominal pain, and nausea in people. Illness in people is usually self-limiting and lasts only 2–4 days, but can become severe in people with weakened immune systems.<ref name=CDCcats2016/> Cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium spp.) Cats transmit the protozoan through their feces. The symptoms in people weight loss and chronic diarrhea in high-risk patients. More than one species of this genus can be acquired by people. Dogs can also transmit this parasite.<ref name=""StullBrophy2015""/><ref name=Bruno2011>{{cite web | title=Zoonoses in the Bedroom|first1=Bruno B.|last1=Chomel|first2=Ben|last2=Sun|date=January 26, 2011|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

==Prevention==
One strategy for the prevention of infection transmission between cats and people is to better educate people on the behaviour that puts them at risk for becoming infected.<ref name=""GurryCampion2017""/>

Those at the highest risk of contracting a disease from a cat are those with behaviors that include: being licked, sharing food, sharing kithchen utensils, kissing, and sleeping with a cat.<ref name =Chomel2014/> The very young, the elderly and those who are immunocompromised increase their risk of becoming infected when sleeping with their cats (and dogs).  The CDC recommends that cat owners not allow a cat to lick your face because it can result in disease transmission. If someone is licked on their face, mucous membranes or an open wound, the risk for infection is reduced if the area is immediately washed with soap and water. Maintaining the health of the animal by regular inspection for fleas and ticks, scheduling deworming medications along with veterinary exams will also reduce the risk of acquiring a feline zoonosis.<ref name=Bruno2011/>

Recommendations for the prevention of ringworm transmission to people include:
* regularly vacuuming areas of the home that pets commonly visit helps to remove fur or flakes of skin
* washing the hands with soap and running water after playing with or petting your pet.
*wearing gloves and long sleeves when handling cats infected with.
*disinfect areas the pet has spent time in, including surfaces and bedding.
**the spores of this fungus can be killed with common disinfectants like chlorine bleach diluted 1:10 (1/4 cup in 1 gallon of water), benzalkonium chloride, or strong detergents.
*not handling cats with ringworm by those whose immune system is weak in any way (if you have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing cancer treatment, or are taking medications that suppress the immune system, for example).
*taking the cat to the veterinarian if ringworm infection is suspected.<ref> {{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/ringworm.html |title = Ringworm (Dermatophytosis Infection) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | accessdate = June 19, 2017 | date = April 30, 2014}}{{CDC}}</ref>

Similar forms exist in Lithuanian ''puižė'' and [[Irish language|Irish]] ''puiscín''.

A [[Pedigree (cat)|pedigreed cat]] is one whose ancestry is recorded by a [[Cat fancy|cat fancier]] organization. A [[purebred cat]] is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as [[show cat]]s. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry are referred to as [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic short-haired]] or [[domestic long-haired cat]]s, by [[Coat (animal)|coat]] type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly [[British English|British]]), or (using terms borrowed from [[Dog breeds|dog breeding]]) mongrels or mutt-cats.

While the [[African wildcat]] is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended, and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed (being subspecies of the same species), several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and entirely wild animals on the other. The semiferal cat, a mostly outdoor cat, is not owned by any one individual, but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households. [[Feral cat]]s are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food, but are typically wary of human interaction.<ref name=""Bradshaw1999"" />

This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a ""pacing"" [[gait]]; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with [[camel]]s and [[giraffe]]s. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a ""diagonal"" gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as [[lizard]]s): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.<ref name=""Christensen 2004"">{{Cite book

}}</ref>  Cats and many other animals have a [[Jacobson's organ]] located in their mouths that allows them to taste-smell certain aromas in a way of which humans have no experience. Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature around {{convert|38|C|abbr=on}} which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated (which would signal to the cat that the ""prey"" item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).<ref name=sch/>
[[File:Kittyply edit1.jpg|thumb|right|The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.]]
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective [[blink reflex]]es to protect the eyes from damage.<ref name=""Case"" />{{rp|47}}

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. In the wild, a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch, as does a [[leopard]].<ref name=""Nash FS"">{{cite web

They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent.

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].<ref name=""Pederson 1989"">{{Cite journal

Perhaps the best known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to ""play"" with prey by releasing it after capture. This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do cats play with their food?|url=http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> This behavior is referred to in the [[idiom]] ""cat-and-mouse game"" or simply ""[[cat and mouse]]"".

Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians. [[Ethology|Ethologist]] Paul Leyhausen proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the [[dominance hierarchy]], in which humans are reacted to as if they are at, or near, the top.<ref name=""Leyhausen 1978"">{{Cite book

[[File:Cats having sex in Israel.jpg|thumb|When cats mate, the tomcat (male) bites the scruff of the female's neck as she assumes a position conducive to [[mating]] known as [[lordosis behavior]].]]
[[File:Radiography of a pregnant cat.jpg|thumb|Radiography of a pregnant cat (about one month and a half)]]
Female cats are seasonally [[polyestrous]], which means they may have many periods of [[Estrus|heat]] over the course of a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days.<ref name=""compendium"" /> Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about 1&nbsp;mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which is a trigger for [[ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.<ref name=""Aronson 1967"">{{Cite journal

After mating, the female washes her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.<ref name=""compendium"" />

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state.

Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.<ref name=""hsus-feral"" />

Some of the same factors that have promoted [[adaptive radiation]] of island [[Bird|avifauna]] over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non-native species in modern time.

Cats can be [[infection|infected]] or infested with [[virus]]es, [[pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]], [[fungus]], [[protozoans]], [[arthropod]]s or worms that can transmit diseases to humans.<ref name=""Chomel2014""/> In some cases, the cat exhibits no [[symptoms]] of the disease,<ref name=Ohio2016>{{cite web | title = Cats |publisher=Ohio Department of Health|url = http://www.odh.ohio.gov/en/odhprograms/bid/zdp/animals/cats | accessdate = 26 November 2016 |date=21 January 2015 }}</ref> However, the same disease can then become evident in a human.  The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person.

Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5,300 years ago in Quanhucun, [[China]] has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans.

==== Superstitions and cat burning ====
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] ""crossing one's path"" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).<ref>{{cite web|title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck? [Hoax]|url=http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/|website=SocialNewsDaily|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>

In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people ""shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]"".<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: a History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-198-20171-0|pages=543}}</ref>

""It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.""<ref>[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]].

**Pasteurellosis is a bacterial disease associated with animal bites and scratches. Pasteurella is a normal bacterium that also lives in the mouths of healthy cats. The [[nonpathogenic organisms|bacteria]] do not typically make cats sick; however, cats can develop abscesses or skin infections in places where they were scratched or bitten by another animal.
In people, pasteurellosis causes painful wound and skin infections. In severe cases, it can cause widespread infection and might even affect the nervous system.
*Rabies, a fatal neurologic disease in animals and people, is caused by a virus. Animals and people are most commonly infected through bites from rabid animals. Infected cats may have a variety of signs, but most often have sudden behavioral changes and progressive paralysis.<ref name=""auto"">https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html {{CDC}}</ref>

==Injuries==
The teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed and cause deep wounds and skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and trap microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assh.org/handcare/hand-arm-injuries/animal-bites-treatment|title=Animal Bites|website=Handcare.org|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref><!-- ==Characteristics== --><!--==Causes==
===Risk factors=== -->

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is aided by obtaining a history of the circumstances surrounding the bite. The time the bite was experienced,  the location of the bite, and examination of the bite is noted. The person may have drainage from the site of the bite. They may also be febrile. Swelling may also occur. Because the wound from the bite may have healed over the punctures, the wound it may be opened and explored. The site is anesthetized prior to exploration of the wound for is examined for damage. Neurovascular status is assessed. Immune status may determine treatment as does  
the presence of transplanted tissue or organs, rheumatic disease, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and sickle cell disease.
Swollen glands (lymph nodes) and red streaks radiating upward may be evident.<ref name = AAP/><ref name = med/><ref name = Man2017/>

The diagnosis of a cat with rabies is evident by observing the cat. Cats with rabies may also appear restless, pant, and attack other animals, people, or objects. Animals with rabies typically die within a few days of appearing sick.  Vaccination of the cat can prevent rabies being transmitted by the cat through a bite. If the cat is suspected of being infected with rabies, the person begins treatment with rabies vaccine.<ref name=""auto""/>

==Prevention== 
<!--(if the section only discusses secondary prevention it should follow the treatment section)-->
Cat bites can often be prevented by:
*instructing children not to tease pets.<ref name=""kidshealth.org"">https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/animal-bites-sheet.html?WT.ac=p-ra</ref>
*being cautious with unfamiliar cats
*approaching cats with care, even if they appear to be friendly.
*avoiding rough play with cats and kittens.

Rough play causes is perceived as aggressive. This will lead to the cat being defensive when approached by people. Preventing cat bites includes not provoking the cat.

==Treatment==
The first step in treatment includes washing and then irrigating the bite wound.<ref name=WHO2013>{{cite web|title=Animal bites Fact sheet N°373|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs373/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=June 17, 2017|date=February 2013}}</ref>
<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html#what-to-do {{CDC}}</ref><ref name = Man2017/> Often a tetanus shot is prescribed.<ref name = kidshealth/> If a cat that has bitten another cat or animal and appears to be ill, the cat would benefit from an assessment and possible treatment from a veterinarian. If there is a low risk that the wound has a low risk of being infected, it is sometimes only sutured.<ref name=WHO2013/> A person who has been bitten by a cat with rabies will need specialized treatment. Resulting infections from cat bites can be prevented by immediately. Washing wounds with soap and warm water is recommended.
Seek medical attention if: if the cat has not been vaccinated against rabies.<ref name=""kidshealth.org""/>
A tetanous booster is given to the person if It has been more than 5 years since their last tetanus shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/cats.html#what-to-do|title=Cats - Healthy Pets Healthy People - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=18 June 2017}}{{CDC}}</ref> If a cat has bitten someone, and there is no evidence that the cat has been vaccinated against rabies, the person will be treated for rabies infection.<ref name = ""auto""/>
<!-- ==Outcomes or Prognosis== -->

==Epidemiology and special populations==
Over 400,000 cat bites occur each year though the actual number of bites is much higher since many such bites are under-reported.<ref name = AAP>{{cite web| publisher = American Academy of Pediatrics |  accessdate = June 17, 2017 | date = 2017 | title = Prevent Bite Wounds | url = https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/prevention/Pages/Prevent-Bite-Wounds.aspx }}</ref>  40 million households in the United States have pet cats.<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/pets/index.html {{CDC}}</ref> Data on the number of people bitten or scratched by cats are limited because these incidents are not reported; however, 20%-80% of cat bites and scratches become infected.<ref name=""LloretEgberink2013""/> Cat-scratch disease or cat-scratch fever, an infection that causes fever and swollen lymph nodes, can develop from cat scratches even if they only break the surface of the skin. Based on reports of people treated for cat bites at hospitals, women are most likely to be victims of cat bites and scratches.<ref name=""auto""/> Because of their smaller build, children are more likely to be bitten on their head, neck and face. Adults are more likely to bitten on the hands and arms.<ref name = Man2017/> Those who are immunocompromised are more susceptible to infection from a cat bite.<ref name = kidshealth/><!--deaths due to cat bites: [[Cait Brennan]] -->

Feline disease are those infections or diseases that infect [[cat]]s. Some of these cause symptoms, sickness or the death of the animal. Some of these are symptomatic in a cat but not in other cats. Some are opportunistic and tend to be more serious in cats that already have other sicknesses. Some of these can be treated and the animal can have a complete recovery. Others, like viral diseases, cannot be treated with antibiotics. This is because antibiotics are not effective against viruses.
