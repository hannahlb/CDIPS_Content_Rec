A '''fish''' is any member of a group of animals that consist of all [[gill]]-bearing [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[craniate]] animals that lack [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] with [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]]. They form a sister group to the [[tunicate]]s, together forming the [[Chordate|olfactores]]. Included in this definition are the living [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, and [[Chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]] as well as various extinct related groups. [[Tetrapod|Tetrapods]] emerged within [[Sarcopterygii|lobe-finned fishes]], so [[Cladistics|cladistically]] they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or [[paraphyletic]] by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term &quot;fish&quot; is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in [[systematics|systematic biology]]. The traditional term '''pisces''' (also '''ichthyes''') is considered a [[wikt:typology|typological]], but not a [[phylogenetic]] classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied [[chordate]]s that first appeared during the [[Cambrian]] period. Although they lacked a [[vertebrate|true spine]], they possessed [[notochord]]s which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the [[Paleozoic]] era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed [[placodermi|external armor]] that protected them from predators. The first fish with [[jaw]]s appeared in the [[Silurian]] period, after which many (such as [[shark]]s) became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of [[arthropod]]s.

Most fish are [[ectotherm]]ic (&quot;cold-blooded&quot;), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [[white shark]] and [[tuna]] can hold a higher [[core temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=K.J. |title=Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1997 |volume=167 |series=B Biochemical Systemic and Environmental Physiology |issue=6 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1007/s003600050092 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |accessdate=12 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=F.G.|author2=Lawson, K.D.|title=Temperature regulation in free-swimming bluefin tuna|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A| date=February 1973 |volume=44|issue=2|pages=375–392|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] and even [[hadal zone|hadal]] depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]). With 33,100 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[FishBase]]|url=http://www.fishbase.org/search.php|title=FishBase |date=April 2015|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially [[fish (food)|as food]]. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in [[wild fisheries]] (see [[fishing]]) or [[Fish farm|farm]] them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see [[aquaculture]]). They are also caught by [[Recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], kept as pets, raised by [[Fishkeeping|fishkeepers]], and exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have had a role in culture through the ages, serving as [[deity|deities]], religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.

==Evolution==
{{main article|Evolution of fish}}
[[File:Dunkleosteus BW.jpg|thumb|''[[Dunkleosteus]]'' was a gigantic, {{convert|10|m|adj=on}} long [[prehistoric fish]] of class Placodermi.|alt=Drawing of animal with large mouth, long tail, very small dorsal fins, and pectoral fins that attach towards the bottom of the body, resembling lizard legs in scale and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/science/jaws-of-steel-on-this-fish-tank/2006/11/29/1164777657728.html|title=Monster fish crushed opposition with strongest bite ever|publisher=[[Smh.com.au]]|date=30 November 2006|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fish do not represent a [[monophyletic]] group, and therefore the &quot;evolution of fish&quot; is not studied as a single event.&lt;ref&gt;G. Lecointre &amp; H. Le Guyader, 2007, ''The Tree of Life: A Phylogenetic Classification'', Harvard University Press Reference Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small, jawless, armored fish known as [[ostracoderm]]s. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the [[lamprey]]s may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed [[mouth]]. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.

Fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have [[Neoteny|kept the larval form into adulthood]] (as some sea squirts do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.

===Taxonomy===
Fish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the &quot;Class Pisces&quot; seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.

Traditional classification divide fish into three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[class (biology)|classes]], and with extinct forms sometimes classified within the tree, sometimes as their own classes:&lt;ref name=&quot;Romer, A 1977&quot;&gt;[[Alfred Romer|Romer, A.S]]. &amp; T.S. Parsons. 1977. ''The Vertebrate Body.'' 5th ed. Saunders, Philadelphia. (6th ed. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benton, M. J. (1998) The quality of the fossil record of vertebrates. Pp. 269–303, in Donovan, S. K. and Paul, C. R. C. (eds), The adequacy of the fossil record, Fig. 2. Wiley, New York, 312 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish)
** Subclass [[Cyclostomata]] ([[hagfish]] and [[lamprey]]s)
** Subclass [[Ostracodermi]] (armoured jawless fish) †
* Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Subclass [[Elasmobranchii]] ([[shark]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]])
** Subclass [[Holocephali]] ([[chimaera]]s and extinct relatives)
* Class [[Placodermi]] (armoured fish) †
* Class [[Acanthodii]] (&quot;spiny sharks&quot;, sometimes classified under bony fishes)†
[[File:Leedsi&amp;Liopl DB.jpg|thumb|[[Leedsichthys]] (left), of the subclass Actinopterygii, is the largest known fish, with estimates in 2005 putting its maximum size at {{convert|16|m}}]]
* Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
** Subclass [[Actinopterygii]] (ray finned fishes)
** Subclass [[Sarcopterygii]] (fleshy finned fishes, ancestors of tetrapods)

The above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in non-specialist and general works. Many of the above groups are paraphyletic, in that they have given rise to successive groups: Agnathans are ancestral to Chondrichthyes, who again have given rise to Acanthodiians, the ancestors of Osteichthyes. With the arrival of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], the fishes has been split up into a more detailed scheme, with the following major groups:
* Class Myxini ([[hagfish]])
* Class [[Pteraspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
* Class [[Thelodonti]] †
* Class [[Anaspida]] †
* Class [[Hyperoartia|Petromyzontida or Hyperoartia]]
** Petromyzontidae ([[lamprey]]s)
* Class [[Conodont]]a (conodonts) †
* Class [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] † (early jawless fish)
** (unranked) [[Galeaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Pituriaspida]] †
** (unranked) [[Osteostraci]] †
* Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]] (jawed vertebrates)
** Class [[Placodermi]] † (armoured fish)
** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Class [[Acanthodii]] † (spiny sharks)
** Superclass [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
*** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Chondrostei]]
***** Order [[Acipenseriformes]] ([[sturgeon]]s and [[paddlefish]]es)
***** Order [[Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s).
**** Subclass [[Neopterygii]]
***** Infraclass [[Holostei]] ([[gar]]s and [[bowfin]]s)
***** Infraclass [[Teleostei]] (many orders of common fish)
*** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Actinistia]] ([[coelacanth]]s)
**** Subclass Dipnoi ([[lungfish]])

† – indicates extinct taxon&lt;br /&gt;Some palaeontologists contend that because [[Conodonta]] are [[chordate]]s, they are primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of this taxonomy, see the [[vertebrate]] article.

The position of [[hagfish]] in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported the idea that the hagfish and the lampreys form a natural group, the [[Cyclostomata]], that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.&lt;ref&gt;Shigehiro Kuraku, Daisuke Hoshiyama, Kazutaka Katoh, Hiroshi Suga, Takashi Miyata (1999) ''Monophyly of Lampreys and Hagfishes Supported by Nuclear DNA–Coded Genes'' J Mol Evol (1999) 49:729–735&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mallatt, J. Sullivan (1998) ''28S and 18S rDNA sequences support the monophyly of lampreys and hagfishes'' Molecular Biology and Evolution V 15, Issue 12, pp 1706–1718&lt;/ref&gt;

The various fish groups account for more than half of vertebrate species. There are almost 28,000 known [[extant taxon|extant]] species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 [[Chondrichthyes|sharks, rays, and chimeras]] and about 108 hagfish and lampreys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are [[Cyprinidae]], [[Gobiidae]], [[Cichlidae]], [[Characidae]], [[Loricariidae]], [[Balitoridae]], [[Serranidae]], [[Labridae]], and [[Scorpaenidae]]. About 64 families are [[monotypic]], containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity==
{{Main article|Diversity of fish}}

&lt;gallery mode=packed title=Examples of the major classes of fish&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The term &quot;fish&quot; most precisely describes any non-[[tetrapod]] [[craniate]] (i.e. an animal with a skull and in most cases a backbone) that has [[gill]]s throughout life and whose limbs, if any, are in the shape of fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nelson|2006|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike groupings such as birds or [[mammal]]s, fish are not a single [[clade]] but a [[paraphyletic]] collection of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[hagfish]]es, [[lamprey]]s, [[Chondrichthyes|sharks and rays]], [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]], [[coelacanth]]s, and [[lungfish]].&lt;ref name=&quot;publishing3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treeoflife&gt;Tree of life web project – [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordates].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, lungfish and coelacanths are closer relatives of [[tetrapod]]s (such as [[mammal]]s, birds, [[Lissamphibia|amphibians]], etc.) than of other fish such as [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] or sharks, so the [[last common ancestor]] of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapods. As paraphyletic groups are no longer recognised in modern [[systematics|systematic biology]], the use of the term &quot;fish&quot; as a biological group must be avoided.

Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s commonly referred to as &quot;fish&quot; are not fish in the sense given above; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction – sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seals]], whales, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrated&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Cleveland P. Hickman, Jr. |author2= Larry S. Roberts|author3= Allan L. Larson|title= Integrated Principles of Zoology|publisher=McGraw-Hill Publishing Co|year=2001|isbn=0-07-290961-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the definition above, all mammals, including [[cetacean]]s like whales and dolphins, are not fish. In some contexts, especially in [[aquaculture]], the true fish are referred to as '''finfish''' (or '''fin fish''') to distinguish them from these other animals.

[[File:leafydragon.jpg|thumb|[[Leafy sea dragon|sea dragon]], a close relative of the [[seahorse]]. Their leaf-like appendages [[camouflage]] them amongst floating [[seaweed]].|alt=Photo of fish with many narrow, straight appendages. Some are end in points, and others are longer, ending in two or three approximately flat, triangular flaps, each with a dark spot.]]

A typical fish is [[ectothermic]], has a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlined]] body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]], and lays eggs.

Each criterion has exceptions. [[Tuna]], [[swordfish]], and some species of [[shark]]s show [[Warm-blooded#Temperature control in cold-blooded animals|some warm-blooded adaptations]]—they can heat their bodies significantly above ambient water temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;publishing3&quot;/&gt; Streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]], and [[Carangidae|jacks]] that can cover 10–20 body-lengths per second to species such as [[eel]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] that swim no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. [[Lungfish]] have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, [[gourami]]s have a structure called the [[labyrinth organ]] that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=53–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as [[seahorse]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[anglerfish]], and [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulpers]]. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in [[moray eel]]s), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as [[Placoid scale|placoid]] (typical of sharks and rays), [[Scale (zoology)#Cosmoid scales|cosmoid]] (fossil lungfish and coelacanths), [[ganoid]] (various fossil fish but also living [[gar]]s and [[bichir]]s), [[cycloid]], and [[ctenoid]] (these last two are found on most [[bony fish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their eggs on land near water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Martin, K.L.M. | title=Beach-Spawning Fishes: Reproduction in an Endangered Ecosystem | year=2014 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=978-1482207972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mudskipper]]s feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Periophthalmus|species=barbarus|year=2006|month=November|id=12803}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single, an [[undescribed species]] of ''[[Phreatobius]]'', has been called a true &quot;land fish&quot; as this worm-like catfish strictly lives among waterlogged [[leaf litter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.planetcatfish.com/catelog/species.php?species_id=646|title=Cat-eLog: Heptapteridae: ''Phreatobius'': ''Phreatobius'' sp.

Fish range in size from the huge {{convert|16|m|adj=on}} [[whale shark]] to the tiny {{convert|8|mm|1|adj=on}} [[stout infantfish]].

Fish [[species]] diversity is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and [[freshwater]] ecosystems. [[Coral reef]]s in the [[Indo-Pacific]] constitute the center of diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental freshwater fishes are most diverse in large [[river basin]]s of [[tropical rainforest]]s, especially the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], [[Congo Basin|Congo]], and [[Mekong]] basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit [[Neotropic]]al freshwaters alone, such that [[Neotropical fish]]es represent about 10% of all [[vertebrate]] species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as [[Cantão State Park]], can contain more freshwater fish species than occur in all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://central2.to.gov.br/arquivo/24/199 Estudo das Espécies Ícticas do Parque Estadual do Cantão], fish species survey of Cantão (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respiration===
{{See also|Aquatic respiration}}

====Gills====
Most fish exchange gases using [[gill]]s on either side of the [[pharynx]]. Gills consist of threadlike structures called [[Protein filament|filaments]]. Each filament contains a [[capillary]] network that provides a large [[surface area]] for exchanging [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[countercurrent exchange]]. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, [[bony fish]] have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum (fish)|operculum]].

Juvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval [[amphibian]]s.

====Air breathing====
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|[[Tuna]] gills inside the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the view looking towards the mouth.|alt=Photo of fish head split in half longitudinally with gill filaments crossing from top to bottom]]
Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended periods. [[Amphibious fish]] such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days,{{doubtful|date=December 2014}} or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of [[anguillidae|anguillid eels]] may absorb oxygen directly. The [[buccal cavity]] of the [[electric eel]] may breathe air. Catfish of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] absorb air through their digestive tracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armbruster1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf|title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes|journal=[[Copeia]]|year=1998|issue=3|pages=663–675 | doi = 10.2307/1447796|format=PDF|accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lungfish]], with the exception of the [[Australian lungfish]], and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. [[Cypriniformes|Loaches]], [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called '''accessory breathing organs''' that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] catfish family.

Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and [[cichlid]]s, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of [[aestivation]] (summertime hibernation) until water returns.

Air breathing fish can be divided into '''obligate air breathers''' and '''facultative air breathers'''. Obligate air breathers, such as the [[African lungfish]], ''must'' breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''[[Hypostomus plecostomus]]'', only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armbruster1998&quot;/&gt;

===Circulation===
[[File:Didactic model of a fish heart--FMVZ USP-09.jpeg|thumb|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a fish heart.|273x273px]]
Fish have a [[circulatory system|closed-loop circulatory system]]. The [[heart]] pumps the blood in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Setaro&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Setaro|first=John F.|year=1999|title=Circulatory System|publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first part is the [[sinus venosus]], a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the second part, the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, [[bulbus arteriosus]], a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the [[aorta]], through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.

===Digestion===
Jaws allow fish to eat a wide variety of food, including plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the [[esophagus]]. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called [[pyloric caeca]], which secrete digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.

===Excretion===
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills. Blood wastes are [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] by the [[kidney]]s.

Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. Their kidneys return water to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]]: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.

===Scales===
{{Main article|Fish scale}}
The scales of fish originate from the mesoderm (skin); they may be similar in structure to teeth.

===Sensory and nervous system===
[[File:Fish brain.png|thumb|upright|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]]|alt=Anatomical diagram showing the pairs of olfactory, telencephalon, and optic lobes, followed by the cerebellum and the mylencephalon]]

====Central nervous system====
Fish typically have quite small brains relative to body size compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish brains are divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobes]], a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt; The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the structural equivalent to the [[cerebrum]] in [[amniote|higher vertebrates]]. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt; Together these structures form the '''forebrain'''.

Connecting the forebrain to the '''midbrain''' is the [[diencephalon]] (in the diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt; The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains [[circadian]] rhythms, and controls color changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt;

The [[midbrain]] or mesencephalon contains the two [[Midbrain#Corpora quadrigemina|optic lobes]]. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt;

The '''hindbrain''' or [[metencephalon]] is particularly involved in swimming and balance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt; The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot; /&gt; Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellae, while the [[mormyrid]] cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt;

The '''brain stem''' or [[myelencephalon]] is the brain's posterior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt; As well as controlling some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman_brain&quot;/&gt;

====Sense organs====
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see [[vision in fishes]]). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]], which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta 99&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orr|first=James|year=1999|title= Fish|publisher=Microsoft Encarta 99|isbn=0-8114-2346-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]], organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431–472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fish, like the South American electric fishes [[Gymnotiformes]], can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.

Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sciences |first=Journal of Undergraduate Life |url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |title=Appropriate maze methodology to study learning in fish |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hn2YJET6?url=http://juls.sa.utoronto.ca/Issues/JULS-Vol2Iss1/JULS-Vol2Iss1-Review3.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vision=====
{{main article|Vision in fishes}}
[[Visual system|Vision]] is an important [[sensory system]] for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrate]]s like [[bird vision|birds]] and mammals, but have a more [[spherical]] [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. Their [[retina]]s generally have both [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] (for [[scotopic vision|scotopic]] and [[photopic vision]]), and most species have [[colour vision]]. Some fish can see [[ultraviolet]] and some can see [[polarized light]]. Amongst [[jawless fish]], the [[lamprey]] has well-developed eyes, while the [[hagfish]] has only primitive [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil A. Campbell

=====Hearing=====
{{see also|Sensory systems in fish#Hearing}}
[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish sense sound using their [[lateral line]]s and their [[otolith|ears]].

====Capacity for pain====
{{Further|Pain in fish}}
Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have [[pain]] and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, [[Batrachoididae|toadfish]] grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Dunayer, Joan, &quot;Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp,&quot; The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12–18&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Scottish scientists at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with [[pain]] in other animals. [[Bee]] [[venom]] and [[acetic acid]] injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm|title=Fish do feel pain, scientists say|work=BBC News | date=30 April 2003|accessdate=4 January 2010|first=Alex|last=Kirby}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grandin183&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Animals in Translation|last=Grandin|first= Temple|authorlink=Temple Grandin|author2=Johnson, Catherine|year=2005|publisher=Scribner|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-7432-4769-8|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;grandin183&quot;/&gt;

Professor James D. Rose of the [[University of Wyoming]]  claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess &quot;conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/Fishwelfare/RoseC.pdf |title=Rose, J.D. 2003.

Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a [[neocortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rose |first=James D. |url= http://www.coloradotu.org/do-fish-feel-pain/|title=Do Fish Feel Pain?|year=2002|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, animal behaviorist [[Temple Grandin]] argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because &quot;different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grandin183&quot;/&gt;

Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible [[suffering]] of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British [[RSPCA]] now formally prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,176-1037515,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscular system===
{{Main article|Fish locomotion}}
[[File:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|Swim bladder of a rudd (''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]'')|alt=Photo of white bladder that consists of a rectangular section and a banana-shaped section connected by a much thinner element]]

Most fish move by alternately contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.

[[File:White shark.jpg|thumb|left|A [[great white shark]] off [[Guadalupe Island|Isla Guadalupe]]|alt=Photo of shark surrounded by school of other fish]]

===Homeothermy===
Although most fish are exclusively [[ectothermic]], there are exceptions.

Certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures. [[Warm-blooded|Endothermic]] [[teleost]]s (bony fish) are all in the suborder [[Scombroidei]] and include the [[billfish]]es, tunas, and one species of &quot;primitive&quot; [[mackerel]] (''Gasterochisma melampus''). All sharks in the family [[Lamnidae]] – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family [[Alopiidae]] ([[thresher sharks]]). The degree of endothermy varies from the [[billfish]], which warm only their eyes and brain, to [[bluefin tuna]] and [[porbeagle shark]]s who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20&amp;nbsp;°C above ambient water temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Block |first1=BA |last2=Finnerty |first2=JR |year=1993 |title=Endothermy in fishes: a phylogenetic analysis of constraints, predispositions, and selection pressures |url=http://www.science.siu.edu/zoology/sears/BlockFinnerty1994.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=283–302 |doi=10.1007/BF00002518 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also [[gigantothermy]]''. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central [[nervous system]] processing, and higher rates of [[digestion]].

===Reproductive system===
{{Further|Fish reproduction|Spawn (biology)}}

[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|[[Organ (anatomy)|Organs]]: 1. [[Liver]], 2. [[Gas bladder]], 3. [[Roe]], 4. Pyloric caeca, 5. [[Stomach]], 6. [[Intestine]]]]
Fish reproductive organs include [[testicle]]s and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes&quot; /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness.

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in [[wiktionary:atherinomorph|atherinomorph]] fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J.|author2=Santos, José E. dos|author3=Santos, Gilmar B.|title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes)|journal=Rev.

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brito&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018|title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil|last=Brito|first=M.F.G.|author2=Bazzoli, N.|journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia|volume=55|issue=5|year=2003|doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018|issn=0102-0935|pages=624–633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]]. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes&quot;/&gt; Secondary gymnovaries are found in [[salmonid]]s and a few other teleosts.

[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes&quot; /&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes&quot; /&gt;

Some fish, like the [[California sheephead]], are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]], and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[clasper]]s.

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Fishegg A.Slotwinski TAFI.jpg|thumb|An example of [[zooplankton]]|alt=Photo of semi-transparent creature with a darker, yolk-like central structure and other approximately round internal elements]] --&gt;
The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[Ichthyoplankton|larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

Some species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. Some viviparous fish exhibit [[oophagy]], in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner&quot;&gt;Meisner, A &amp; Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae)&quot; ''Journal of Morphology'' 234, pp. 295–317, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meisner&quot; /&gt;

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearer]]s.

==Diseases==
{{Main article|Fish diseases and parasites}}
Like other animals, fish suffer from diseases and parasites. To prevent disease they have a variety of defenses. ''Non-specific'' defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] that traps and inhibits the growth of [[microorganism]]s. If [[pathogen]]s breach these defenses, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers [[white blood cells]] that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, [[vaccine]]s have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example [[furunculosis]] vaccines in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].&lt;ref&gt;R.

Some species use [[cleaner fish]] to remove external parasites. The best known of these are the [[Bluestreak cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''Labroides'' found on [[coral reef]]s in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. These small fish maintain so-called &quot;cleaning stations&quot; where other fish congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, ''Etroplus maculatus'', the cleaner, and the much larger ''Etroplus suratensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wyman | first1 = Richard L. | last2 = Ward | first2 = Jack A. | year = 1972 | title = A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis.

===Immune system===
Immune organs vary by type of fish.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. ''Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish.'' In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pp. 1–55.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfish), true [[lymph]]oid organs are absent. These fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature.) They resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.
[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to [[Chondrichthyes]]; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the [[Leydig's organ]] within the walls of their esophagus, and a [[spiral valve]] in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocyte]]s, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.
[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish, and bichirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system.) Their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cell]]s and a small number of [[macrophage]]s. The chondrostean kidney is an important [[hemopoietic]] organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop.

Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), which houses many different immune cells.&lt;ref&gt;D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chilmonczyk |first=S. |title=''The thymus in fish: development and possible function in the immune response''|publisher=[[Annual Review of Fish Diseases]]|volume=2|year=1992|pages=181–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hansen |first=J.D. |last2=Zapata |first2=A.G. |year=1998 |title=''Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians''|publisher=Immunological Reviews|volume=166 |pages=199–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a lymphatic system similar to that in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the [[zebrafish]]. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) [[T cell]]s accumulate while waiting to encounter an [[antigen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kucher |title=''Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VegFc signalling''|publisher=[[Current Biology]]|volume=16|year=2006|pages=1244–1248|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B and T lymphocytes bearing [[immunoglobulin]]s and [[T cell receptor]]s, respectively, are found in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the [[adaptive immune system]] as a whole [[adaptive immune system#Evolution|evolved]] in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Flajnik, M. F., and M. Kasahara. &quot;Origin and evolution of the adaptive immune system: genetic events and selective pressures.&quot; Nature Reviews Genetics 11.1, 47-59 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The 2006 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] names 1,173 fish species that are threatened with extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1|title=Table 1: Numbers of threatened species by major groups of organisms (1996–2004)|accessdate=18 January 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1|publisher=iucnredlist.org |archivedate=30 June 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included are species such as [[Gadus morhua|Atlantic cod]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/8784/summ|title=Gadus morhua (Atlantic Cod)|publisher=Iucnredlist.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprinodon diabolis|Devil's Hole pupfish]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/6149/summ|title=Cyprinodon diabolis (Devils Hole Pupfish)|publisher=Iucnredlist.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coelacanth]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/11375/summ|title=Latimeria chalumnae (Coelacanth, Gombessa)|publisher=Iucnredlist.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[great white shark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/3855/summ|title=Carcharodon carcharias (Great White Shark)|publisher=Iucnredlist.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants, and information about fish populations is often lacking. However, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water bodies. For example, the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]] occupies only a single {{convert|3|by|6|m|0}} pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|pp=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overfishing===
[[File:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|thumb|A [[Whale shark]], the world's largest fish, is classified as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]].|alt=Photo of shark in profile surrounded by other, much smaller fish in bright sunlight]]
{{Main article|Overfishing}}

Overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such as cod and [[tuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm|title=Call to halt cod 'over-fishing'|accessdate=18 January 2006|work=BBC News|date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm|title=Tuna groups tackle overfishing |accessdate=18 January 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|date=26 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overfishing eventually causes [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population]] (known as [[Fish stock|stock]]) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such '''commercial extinction''' does not mean that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.

One well-studied example of fishery collapse is the [[Pacific sardine]] ''Sadinops sagax caerulues'' fishery off the California coast. From a 1937 peak of {{convert|790000|LT}} the catch steadily declined to only {{convert|24000|LT}} in 1968, after which the fishery was no longer economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main tension between [[fisheries science]] and the [[fishing industry]] is that the two groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the [[commercial fishing|fishing industry]] is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm|title=UK 'must shield fishing industry'|accessdate=18 January 2006 |work=BBC News|date=3 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm|title=EU fish quota deal hammered out|accessdate=18 January 2006|work=BBC News|date=21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html|title=Ocean study predicts the collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050|accessdate=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm|title=Atlantic bluefin tuna could soon be commercially extinct|accessdate=18 January 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070430205610/http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm|archivedate=30 April 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitat destruction===
{{See also|Environmental impact of fishing}}

A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including [[water pollution]], the building of dams, removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the [[pallid sturgeon]], a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126220804/http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html|archivedate=26 November 2005 |url= http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html|title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon ''Scaphirhynchus'' Fact Sheet|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exotic species===
Introduction of [[invasive species|non-native]] species has occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of [[Nile perch]] into [[Lake Victoria]] in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 [[Endemism|endemic]] [[cichlid]] species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/life/feature/story/0,,1541613,00.html|title=The little fish fight back|accessdate=18 January 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|location= London|first=Laura|last=Spinney|date=4 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carp]], [[Channidae|snakeheads]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html|title=Stop That Fish!|accessdate=26 August 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tilapia]], [[perch|European perch]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[sea lamprey]]s are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.

==Importance to humans==

===Economic importance===
{{Main article|Fishing industry|Aquaculture|Fish farming}}
[[File:Community fish-farming ponds in the rural town of Masi Manimba, DRC (7609946524).jpg|alt=A row of square artificial ponds, with trees on either side|thumb|These fish-farming ponds were created as a [[cooperative]] project in a rural village.]]

Throughout history, humans have utilized [[Fish as food|fish as a food source]]. Historically and today, most fish [[protein]] has come by means of catching wild fish. However, aquaculture, or fish farming, which has been practiced since about 3,500 BCE. in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spalding|first1=Mark|title=Sustainable Ancient Aquaculture|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/11/sustainable-ancient-aquaculture/|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=13 August 2015|date=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is becoming increasingly important in many nations. Overall, about one-sixth of the world's protein is estimated to be provided by fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helfman|first1=Gene S.|title=Fish Conservation: A Guide to Understanding and Restoring Global Aquatic Biodiversity and Fishery Resources|date=2007|publisher=Island Press|isbn=1597267600|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That proportion is considerably elevated in some [[developing nation]]s and regions heavily dependent on the sea. In a similar manner, fish have been tied to trade.

Catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known as [[fishing]], while the organized effort by humans to catch fish is called a [[fishery]]. Fisheries are a huge global business and provide income for millions of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfman&quot; /&gt; The annual yield from all fisheries worldwide is about 154 million tons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Review of Fisheries and Aquaculture |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i2727e/i2727e01.pdf|website=fao.org|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]]|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with popular species including [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], and [[salmon]]. However, the term fishery is broadly applied, and includes more organisms than just fish, such as [[Mollusca|mollusks]] and [[crustacean]]s, which are often called &quot;fish&quot; when used as food.

===Recreation===
{{Main article|Fishkeeping|Recreational fishing|Angling}}
Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in [[cave art]], being raised as [[ornamental fish]] in [[pond]]s, and displayed in [[aquarium]]s in homes, offices, or public settings.

''Recreational fishing'' is fishing for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with [[commercial fishing]], which is fishing for profit. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[fish hook|hook]]s and any one of a wide range of [[bait (luring substance)|baits]]. Angling is a method of fishing, specifically the practice of catching fish by means of an &quot;angle&quot; (hook). Anglers must select the right hook, [[cast net|cast]] accurately, and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather conditions, species, fish response, time of the day, and other factors.

=== Culture ===
{{main|Fish in culture}}

[[File:Matsya painting.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] as a [[Matsya]]|alt=Photo of painting showing blue-skinned, 4-armed upper body of man standing in the opened mouth of a fish with bent tail with other, paler men facing him with hands raised together]]
[[File:PELSO.png|thumb|Spread of Seuso at Lake Balaton]]
Fish feature prominently in art and literature, in movies such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and books such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of [[Horror film|horror movies]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], most notably the novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'', which spawned a series of films of the [[Jaws (film)|same name]] that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as ''[[Shark Tale]]'' and ''[[Snakehead Terror]]''. Piranhas are shown in a similar light to sharks in films such as ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''; however, contrary to popular belief, the [[red-bellied piranha]] is actually a generally timid scavenger species that is unlikely to harm humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zollinger|first1=Sue Anne|title=Piranha–Ferocious Fighter or Scavenging Softie?|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/piranhaferocious-fighter-scavenging-softie/|website=A Moment of Science|publisher=Indiana Public Media|accessdate=1 November 2015|date=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Jonah]] a &quot;great fish&quot; swallowed [[Jonah]] the [[Prophet]]. Legends of half-human, half-fish [[mermaid]]s have featured in folklore, including the stories of [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

[[File:Ichthus.svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[ichthys|ichthus]] is a Christian symbol of a fish signifying that the person who uses it is a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/asktheexpert/oct26.html |first=Elesha |last=Coffman |title=What is the origin of the Christian fish symbol? |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Fish themes have symbolic significance in many religions. The fish is used often as a symbol by Christians to represent [[Jesus]], or [[Christianity]] in general; the [[gospel]]s also refer to &quot;fishers of men&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew 4:19]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feeding the multitude]]. In the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|dhamma]] of [[Buddhism]] the fish symbolize happiness as they have complete freedom of movement in the water. Often drawn in the form of [[Asian carp|carp]] which are regarded in the Orient as sacred on account of their elegant beauty, size and life-span. Among the [[deity|deities]] said to take the form of a fish are [[Ika-Roa]] of the [[Polynesians]], [[Dagon#Fish-god tradition|Dagon]] of various ancient [[Semitic people]]s, the shark-gods of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and [[Matsya]] of the Hindus.

The [[astrology|astrological]] symbol [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] is based on a constellation of the [[Pisces (constellation)|same name]], but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky, [[Piscis Austrinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piscis Austrinus|url=http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/piscisaustrinus/constell.html|website=allthesky.com|publisher=The Deep Photographic Guide to the Constellations|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
===Fish or fishes===
Though often used interchangeably, in biology these words have different meanings. ''Fish'' is used as a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. ''Fishes'' is used to describe different species or species groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pauly2004&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Pauly|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Pauly|title=Fish(es)|encyclopedia=Darwin's Fishes: An Encyclopedia of Ichthyology, Ecology, and Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTDa0fM4vQIC&amp;pg=PA77|date=13 May 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45181-9|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph S. Nelson|Nelson, Joseph S]] and Paetz, Martin Joseph (1992) [http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf ''The Fishes of Alberta''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407085249/http://www.uap.ualberta.ca/images/pdfs/9780888642363.pdf |date=7 April 2014 }} page 400, University of Alberta. {{ISBN|9780888642363}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;publishing5&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Helfman|Collette|Facey|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.

===True fish and finfish=== &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[True fish]], [[Fin-fish]] and [[Finfish]] redirect here --&gt;
* In biology, the term ''fish'' is most strictly used to describe any animal with a [[Vertebral column|backbone]] that has [[gill]]s throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of [[fin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Fishes of the World]]|last=Nelson|first=Joseph S.|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0-471-25031-7|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s with common names ending in &quot;fish&quot; are not fish in this [[Fish#Definition|sense]]; examples include [[shellfish]], [[cuttlefish]], [[starfish]], [[crayfish]] and [[jellyfish]]. In earlier times, even biologists did not make a distinction—sixteenth century natural historians classified also [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[whale]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[crocodile]]s, even [[hippopotamus]]es, as well as a host of aquatic invertebrates, as fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;integrated&quot; /&gt;
* In fisheries, the term ''fish'' is used as a collective term, and includes [[mollusk]]s, [[crustacean]]s and any [[aquatic animal]] which is harvested.&lt;ref name=&quot;fao glossary&quot;&gt;[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp ''Fisheries glossary'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strict biological definition of a fish, above, is sometimes called a ''true fish''. True fish are also referred to as ''finfish'' or ''fin fish'' to distinguish them from other aquatic life harvested in fisheries or aquaculture.

===Shoal or school===
{{Main article|Shoaling and schooling}}
[[File:School of Pterocaesio chrysozona in Papua New Guinea 1.jpg|thumb|These [[goldband fusilier]]s are [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] because their swimming is synchronised|alt=Photo of thousands of fish separated from each other by distances of {{convert|2|in}} or less]]

A random assemblage of fish merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an ''aggregation''. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A ''shoal'' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. ''Schools'' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Helfman |first=G. |last2=Collette |first2=B. |last3=Facey |first3=D. |year=1997 |title= The Diversity of Fishes|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]]|page=375 |isbn=0-86542-256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an ''aggregation''.
* Many minnows and characins form ''shoals''.
* Anchovies, herrings and silversides are classic examples of ''schooling'' fish.

While the words &quot;school&quot; and &quot;shoal&quot; have different meanings within biology, the distinctions are often ignored by non-specialists who treat the words as [[synonym]]s. Thus speakers of [[British English]] commonly use &quot;shoal&quot; to describe any grouping of fish, and speakers of [[American English]] commonly use &quot;school&quot; just as loosely.&lt;ref&gt;Pitcher T. J. and Parish J. K. (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Behaviour+of+teleost+fishes%22+%22%22Functions+of+shoaling+behaviour+in+teleosts%22%22&amp;num=50&amp;ei=JzYKSpyWM42GkQSM992bBA &quot;Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts&quot;] In: Pitcher T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="624">There are well over 20,000 species of fish, each with a unique scientific name.  In addition to their scientific name, many species have one or more common ([[vernacular]]) names.  With so many species in so many places, it is inevitable that many common names are applied to more than one species. This [[Wikipedia:Category|category]] contains pages that describe or list the fish species that share a common name.

''Note: Disambiguation pages are categorized in [[:Category:Fish common name disambiguation pages]].''

                 Wikipedia outlines are
              a special type of list article.
              They make up one of Wikipedia's

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to fish:

'''[[Fish]]''' – any member of a [[paraphyletic]] group of organisms that consist of all [[gill]]-bearing [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[craniate]] animals that lack [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] with [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]].  Included in this definition are the living [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]]s, and [[chondrichthyes|cartilaginous]] and [[bony fish]], as well as various extinct related groups. Most fish are [[ectotherm]]ic (&quot;cold-blooded&quot;), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like [[white shark]] and [[tuna]] can hold a higher core temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=K.J. |title=Regulation of body temperature in the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'' |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology |year=1997 |volume=167 |series=B Biochemical Systemic and Environmental Physiology |issue=6 |pages=423–429 |doi=10.1007/s003600050092 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/temperature-and-activities-of-a-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias/ |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Lawson |first2=K.D. |last=Carey |first=F.G. |title=Temperature regulation in free-swimming bluefin tuna |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |date=1 February 1973 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=375–392 |doi=10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) to the [[abyssal zone|abyssal]] and even [[hadal zone|hadal]] depths of the deepest [[ocean]]s (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]). At 32,000 species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;[[FishBase]]: [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php February 2011 Update.] Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="992">;The study of fish (ichthyology)
Fish have been studied by [[Biology|biologists]] for centuries, in what is called [[ichthyology]]. For more details refer to the [[:Category:Ichthyology|Ichthyology category]].

;Fish caught by anglers or fishing
Most fish that [[Fisherman|anglers]] catch while fishing are within [[:Category:Ray-finned fish|Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fish]]. Further information about [[:Category:Fishing|Fishing]] can be found in the [[:Category:Fishing|Fishing]] category.

'''Whales''' are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] [[placental mammal|placental]] [[marine mammal]]s. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder [[Cetacea]], usually excluding [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order [[Cetartiodactyla]] with [[even-toed ungulate]]s and their closest living relatives are the [[Hippopotamidae|hippopotamuses]], having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti) and [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise of eight [[Neontology|extant]] [[Family (biology)|families]]: [[Balaenopteridae]] (the rorquals), [[Balaenidae]] (right whales), [[Cetotheriidae]] (the pygmy right whale), [[Eschrichtiidae]] (the grey whale), [[Monodontidae]] (belugas and narwhals), [[Physeteridae]] (the sperm whale), [[Kogiidae]] (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and [[Ziphiidae]] (the beaked whales).

Whales are creatures of the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their adaptation to life underwater that they are unable to survive on land. Whales range in size from the {{convert|2.6|m|ft}} and {{convert|135|kg|lbs}} [[dwarf sperm whale]] to the {{convert|29.9|m|ft}} and {{convert|190|MT|ST}} [[blue whale]], which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The [[sperm whale]] is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]], in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the [[krill]] and [[plankton]] which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth designed for catching fish or [[squid]]. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of &quot;smell&quot;, whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.

Whales have evolved from land-living mammals. As such they must breathe air regularly, though they can remain submerged for long periods. They have [[Blowhole (anatomy)|blowholes]] (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. They are [[Endotherm|warm-blooded]], and have a layer of fat, or [[blubber]], under the skin. With streamlined [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], though they are not as flexible or agile as [[Pinniped|seals]]. Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the [[humpback whale]]. Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years.

Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The [[North Atlantic right whale]]s nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the [[Gray whale#North Pacific|North Pacific grey whale population]] is ranked [[Critically Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]]. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and [[baleen]] of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]''. Small whales, such as [[beluga whale|belugas]], are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. [[Whale watching]] has become a form of tourism around the world.

==Etymology and definitions==
The word &quot;whale&quot; comes from the [[Old English]] ''whæl'', related to the [[High German]] ''wal''. Related forms are the [[Old Norse]] ''hvalr'' and the Swedish/Danish ''hval''. The obsolete &quot;whalefish&quot; has a similar derivation, indicating a time when whales were thought to be fish. Other archaic English forms include ''wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal'', etc.{{sfn|Skeat|1898}}

The term &quot;whale&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s, acting as a synonym for [[Cetacea]]. Six species of dolphins have the word &quot;whale&quot; in their name, collectively known as blackfish: the [[killer whale]], the [[melon-headed whale]], the [[pygmy killer whale]], the [[false killer whale]], and the two species of [[pilot whale]]s, all of which are classified under the family [[Delphinidae]] (oceanic dolphins).{{sfn|Leatherwood et al.|1991|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;33–65}} Each species has a different reason for it, for example, the killer whale was named &quot;Ballena asesina&quot; by Spanish sailors, which translates directly to &quot;whale assassin&quot; or &quot;whale killer&quot;, but is more often translated to &quot;killer whale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=xwvWILe_c_cC|page=10}}|first=Gerard|last=Gormley|year=1990|title=Orcas of the Gulf: A Natural History|publisher= toExcel|location=Lincoln, NE|page=10|isbn=978-0-595-01118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hippo pod edit.jpg|thumb|The [[Hippopotamidae|hippopotamus]]es are the [[sister clade]] to the [[Cetacea]], which contains whales, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s.]]
The whales are part of the largely terrestrial mammalian [[clade]] Laurasiatheria. Whales do not form a clade or order; the infraorder Cetacea includes [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]], which are not considered whales.

Cetaceans are divided into two parvorders: the largest parvorder, [[Mysticeti]] (baleen whales), is characterized by the presence of baleen, a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of [[keratin]], which it uses to filter [[plankton]], among others, from the water; [[Odontoceti|Odontocetes]] (toothed whales) are characterized by bearing sharp teeth for hunting, as opposed to their counterparts' baleen.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;4}}

Cetaceans and [[artiodactyl]]s now are classified under the order [[Cetartiodactyla]], often still referred to as Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and [[hippopotamus]]es. The hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.{{sfn|Gatesy|1997}}

===Mysticetes===
{{See also|Mysticeti}}
Mysticetes are also known as baleen whales. They have a pair of [[Blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]]s side-by-side and lack teeth, which renders them incapable of catching larger prey; they instead have [[baleen plates]] which is a sieve-like structure in the upper jaw made of keratin, which they use to filter plankton and other food from the water; this forces them to follow [[krill]] or [[plankton]] migrations. Some whales, such as the humpback, reside in the polar regions where they feed on a reliable source of schooling fish and krill.{{sfn|Johnson et al.|1984|loc=[http://spo.nwr.noaa.gov/mfr464/mfr4647.pdf ''Megaptera novaeangliae'']}} These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and [[Caudal fin|tail fin]] up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their [[thoracic vertebrae]] at the [[proximal]] end, but do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as the pressure increases.{{sfn|Cozzi et al.|2009}}  Mysticetes consist of four families: [[Balaenopteridae|rorquals (balaenopterids)]], [[Cetotheriidae|cetotheriids]], [[Balaenidae|right whales (balaenids)]], and [[Eschrichtiidae|grey whales (eschrichtiids)]].

The main difference between each family of mysticete is in their feeding adaptations and subsequent behaviour. 
Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, along with the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while feeding. The throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more efficient capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.{{sfn|Goldbogen|2010}}
Balaenids are the right whales. These animals have very large heads, which can make up as much as 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.{{sfn|Froias|2012}}
Eschrichtiids have one living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating crustaceans and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning on their sides and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.{{sfn|Jefferson et al.}}

===Odontocetes===
{{See also|Odontoceti}}

Odontocetes are known as toothed whales; they have teeth and only one blowhole. They rely on their well-developed sonar to find their way in the water. Toothed whales send out [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] clicks using the [[melon (cetacean)|melon]]. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted.{{sfn|Jeanette et al.|1990|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;203–427}} All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and [[Caudal fin|tail fin]] up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their [[thoracic vertebrae]] at the [[proximal]] end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure.{{sfn|Cozzi et al.|2009}} Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: [[Monodontidae|belugas and narwhals (monodontids)]], [[Physeteridae|sperm whales (physeterids)]], [[Kogiidae|dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids)]], and [[Ziphiidae|beaked whales (ziphiids)]]. There are six species, sometimes referred to as &quot;blackfish&quot;, that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the [[killer whale]], the [[melon-headed whale]], the [[pygmy killer whale]], the [[false killer whale]], and the two species of [[pilot whale]]s, all of which are classified under the family [[Delphinidae]] (oceanic dolphins).{{sfn|Leatherwood et al.|1991|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;33–65}}

The differences between families of odontocetes include size, feeding adaptations and distribution.
Monodontids consist of two species: the [[beluga whale|beluga]] and the [[narwhal]]. They both reside in the frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods near the surface and around pack ice, their coloration acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.{{sfn|Jefferson|2015a}}
Physeterids and Kogiids consist of [[sperm whale]]s. Sperm whales consist the largest and smallest odontocetes, and spend a large portion of their life hunting squid. ''P. macrocephalus'' spends most of its life in search of squid in the depths; these animals do not require any degree of light at all, in fact, blind sperm whales have been caught in perfect health. The behaviour of Kogiids remains largely unknown, but, due to their small lungs, they are thought to hunt in the [[photic zone]].{{sfn|Jefferson|2015b}}
Ziphiids consist of 22 species of [[beaked whale]]. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, but they all share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided by a pair of grooves on the underside of their head, not unlike the throat pleats on the [[rorqual]]s, to feed.{{sfn|Jefferson|2015c}}

===Evolution===
[[File:Basilosaurus cetoides (1).jpg|right|thumb|350px|[[Basilosaurus]] skeleton]]
{{Main article|Evolution of cetaceans}}

Whales are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the [[artiodactyl]] [[order (biology)|order]] (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the ''[[Indohyus]]'', an extinct [[chevrotain|chevrotain-like]] ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.{{sfn|ScienceDaily|2007}}{{sfn|Dawkins|2004}} Primitive cetaceans, or [[archaeocetes]], first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic 5–10 million years later. What defines an archaeocete is the presence of anatomical features exclusive to cetaceans, alongside other primitive features not found in modern cetaceans, such as visible legs or asymmetrical teeth.{{sfn|Berkeley}}{{sfn|Thewissen|2007}}{{sfn|Falkhe et al.|2011}}{{sfn|Gatesy|1997}} Their features became adapted for living in the [[Sea|marine environment]]. Major anatomical changes included their hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone (''[[Ambulocetus]]'' 49 [[Mya (unit)|mya]]), a [[streamline (fluid dynamics)|streamlined]] body and the growth of flukes on the tail (''[[Protocetus]]'' 43 mya), the migration of the nostrils toward the top of the [[cranium]] ([[Blowhole (anatomy)|blowholes]]), and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers (''[[Basilosaurus]]'' 35 mya), and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs (the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 mya).{{sfn|Kenneth|2001}}{{sfn|Bebej et al.|2012}}{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;508}}

Whale morphology shows a number of examples of [[convergent evolution]], the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://marinediscovery.arizona.edu/lessonsF99/andylam/ |title=The Convergent Evolution of Marine Fish and Whales |last=Lam  |first=Andy |publisher=The University of Arizona |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include the use of [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] for hunting in low light conditions&amp;nbsp;— which is the same hearing adaptation used by [[bat]]s&amp;nbsp;— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in [[pelican]]s, that enable engulfment feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/14404-rorqual-whales-pelicans-jaw-convergent-evolution.html |title=Jaw-Dropping Similarity Found in Whales and Pelicans |last=Moskowitz |first=Clara |publisher=Live Science |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the [[hippopotamus]]es; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 mya.{{sfn|Gatesy|1997}} Around 40 mya, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and [[anthracotheres]]; nearly all anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene 2.5 mya, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage&amp;nbsp;– the hippopotamus.{{sfn|Boisserie et al.|2005|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;1537–1541}}

Whales split into two separate parvorders around 34 mya&amp;nbsp;– the baleen whales (Mysticetes) and the toothed whales (Odontocetes).{{sfn|PBSa|2012}}{{sfn|Houben et al.|2013|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;341–344}}{{sfn|Steeman et al.|2009|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;573–585}}

==Biology==

===Anatomy===
[[File:Baleen parts.png|thumb|right|Features of a [[blue whale]]]]
[[File:Sperm whale skeleton labelled.jpg|thumb|Features of a [[sperm whale]] skeleton]]
Whales have torpedo shaped bodies with non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a large tail fin, and flat heads (with the exception of [[Monodontidae|monodontids]] and [[Ziphiidae|ziphiids]]). Whale skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts (with the exception of monodontids and ziphiids) and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Whales range in size from the {{convert|2.6|m|ft|adj=on}} and {{convert|135|kg|lbs|adj=on}} dwarf sperm whale to the {{convert|34|m|ft|adj=on}} and {{convert|190|MT|ST|adj=on}} blue whale. Overall, they tend to dwarf other cetartiodactyls; the blue whale is the largest creature on earth. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. One exception is with the sperm whale, which has males larger than the females.{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;510–511}}{{sfn|Ralls|1984|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;1005–1011}}

Odontocetes, such as the sperm whale, possess teeth with [[cementum]] cells overlying [[dentine]] cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] on the portion of the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large [[whalebone]], as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;509–510}}

Breathing involves expelling stale air from the [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]], forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;507–508}}{{sfn|Scholander|1940}}

All whales have a thick layer of [[blubber]]. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with buoyancy (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;5}}{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;510}}

Whales have a two- to three-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. Mysticetes contain a [[proventriculus]] as an extension of the [[oesophagus]]; this contains stones that grind up food. They also have [[Fundic stomach|fundic]] and [[Pyloric stomach|pyloric]] chambers.{{sfn|Edward|1995|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;11}}

===Locomotion===
[[File:GreenlandWhaleLyd3.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of a [[bowhead whale]]; notice the hind limb. [[Richard Lydekker]], 1894]]
Whales have two flippers on the front, and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although whales do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some, such as the sperm whale and bowhead whale, possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Whales are fast swimmers in comparison to seals, which typically cruise at 5–15 kn, or {{convert|9|–|28|kph|mph}}; the fin whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to {{convert|47|kph|mph}} and the sperm whale can reach speeds of {{convert|35|kph|mph}}. The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility; whales are unable to turn their heads. When swimming, whales rely on their tail fin propel them through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour|log]] out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a [[dorsal fin]].{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;122–262}}{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;508}}

Whales are adapted for diving to great depths. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they can slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen; blood is rerouted from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart and brain among other organs; [[haemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]] store oxygen in body tissue; and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than haemoglobin. Before going on long dives, many whales exhibit a behaviour known as sounding; they  stay close to the surface for a series of short, shallow dives while building their oxygen reserves, and then make a sounding dive.{{sfn|Cozzi et al.|2009}}{{sfn|Norena et al.|2000|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;181–191}}

===Senses===
[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|right|[[Biosonar]] by cetaceans]]
[[File:Sperm whale drawing with skeleton.jpg|thumb|right|Sperm whale skeleton. Richard Lydekker, 1894.]]

The whale ear has specific adaptations to the [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] environment. In humans, the [[middle ear]] works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low [[Acoustic impedance|impedance]] and the [[cochlea]]r fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear.{{sfn|Cranford et al.|2008}} The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater.{{sfn|Nummela|2007|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;716–733}} Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a [[melon (cetacean)|melon]]. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.{{sfn|Jeanette et al.|1990|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;1–19}}{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;512}}{{sfn|Thewissen|2002}}{{sfn|Ketten|1992|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;717–750}}

The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both [[rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell|cone]] cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for  colour vision than most mammals.{{sfn|Mass et al.|2007|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;701–715}} Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a  [[tapetum lucidum]]; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. In water, a whale can see around {{convert|10.7|m|ft}} ahead of itself,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}{{quotation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;!--Distance specified. Please supply enough context to prove generality of claim--&gt; but they have a smaller range above water. They also have glands on the eyelids and [[corneal epithelium|outer corneal layer]] that act as protection for the cornea.{{sfn|Jeanette et al.|1990|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;505–519}}{{sfn|Reidenberg|2012|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;512}}

The [[olfactory lobes]] are absent in toothed whales, suggesting that they have no sense of smell. Some whales, such as the [[bowhead whale]], possess a [[vomeronasal organ]], which does mean that they can &quot;sniff out&quot; krill.{{sfn|Jeanette et al.|1990|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;481–505}}

Whales are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether.  However, some toothed whales have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste. The presence of the Jacobson's organ indicates that whales can smell food once inside their mouth, which might be similar to the sensation of taste.{{sfn|Jeanette et al.|1990|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;447–455}}

===Communication===
{{Main article|Whale vocalization}}
{{Listen|filename=Whales and Dolphins whale nature sounds songs nueva esparta.ogg|title=Humpback whale &quot;song&quot;|description=Recording of Humpback Whales singing and Clicking.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Whale vocalization is likely to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the humpback whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as [[whale sound|whale song]]. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species. Humpback whales only have been heard making clicks, while toothed whales use [[biosonar|sonar]] that may generate up to 20,000 watts of sound (+73&amp;nbsp;[[dBm]] or +43&amp;nbsp;[[Decibel watt|dBw]]){{sfn|Whitehead|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;4}} and be heard for many miles.

Captive whales have occasionally been known to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of the whales to communicate with humans, as whales have a very different vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.{{sfn|Collins|2012}}

Whales emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals, which are called whistles and clicks:{{sfn|Mann|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;9}}
Clicks are quick broadband burst pulses, used for [[biosonar|sonar]], although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of belugas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of ~35–50 [[millisecond]]s, and in general these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.
Whistles are narrow-band [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated (FM)]] signals, used for communicative purposes, such as contact calls.

===Intelligence===
{{Main article|Cetacean intelligence}}
{{See also|Cetacean surfacing behaviour}}

Whales are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve.{{sfn|Siebert|2009}} The neocortex of many species of whale is home to elongated [[spindle neurons]] that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids.{{sfn|Watson|2006|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;1107–1112}} In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions,  judgement, and theory of mind. Whale spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.{{sfn|Hof|2007|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;1–31}}

[[File:Whales Bubble Net Feeding-edit1.jpg|thumb|Bubble net feeding]]

[[Brain size]] was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. [[Allometric]] analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the ⅔ or ¾ exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an [[encephalization quotient|encephalisation quotient]] that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. [[Sperm whale]]s have the largest brain mass of any animal on earth, averaging {{convert|8,000|cm3|in3}} and {{convert|7.8|kg|lbs}} in mature males, in comparison to the average human brain which averages {{convert|1450|cm3|in3}} in mature males.{{sfn|NOAAa}} The [[brain to body mass ratio]] in some odontocetes, such as belugas and narwhals, is second only to humans.{{sfn|Fields}}

Small whales are known to engage in complex play behaviour, which includes such things as producing stable underwater [[toroid]]al air-core [[vortex]] rings or &quot;[[bubble ring]]s&quot;. There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring, or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the [[Helix|helical]] vortex currents thus formed. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings, so that they burst into many separate bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface.{{sfn|Metcalfe}} Some believe this is a means of communication.{{sfn|Griffin|2015}} Whales are also known to produce bubble-nets for the purpose of foraging.{{sfn|Wiley|2011|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;575–602}}

[[File:Southern right whale4.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[southern right whale]] sailing]]

Larger whales are also thought, to some degree, to engage in play. The [[southern right whale]], for example, elevates their tail fluke above the water, remaining in the same position for a considerable amount of time. This is known as &quot;sailing&quot;. It appears to be a form of play and is most commonly seen off the coast of [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Humpback whale]]s, among others, are also known to display this behaviour.{{sfn|Leighton et al.|2007|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;17–21}}

=== {{anchor|Reproduction}} Life cycle===
{{See also|Right whale#Courtship and reproduction|Fin whale#Breeding}}

Whales are fully aquatic creatures, which means that birth and courtship behaviours are very different from terrestrial and semi-aquatic creatures. Since they are unable to go onto land to calve, they deliver the baby with the  fetus positioned for tail-first delivery. This prevents the baby from drowning either upon or during delivery. To feed the new-born, whales, being aquatic, must squirt the milk into the mouth of the calf. Being mammals, they have mammary glands used for nursing calves; they are weaned off at about 11 months of age. This milk contains high amounts of fat which is meant to hasten the development of blubber; it contains so much fat that it has the consistency of toothpaste.{{sfn|Modern Marvels|2007}} Females deliver a single calf with gestation lasting about a year, dependency until one to two years, and maturity around seven to ten years, all varying between the species.{{sfn|Johnson et al.|loc=[http://spo.nwr.noaa.gov/mfr464/mfr4647.pdf ''Megaptera novaeangliae'']}} This [[R/K selection theory|mode of reproduction]] produces few offspring, but increases the survival probability of each one. Females, referred to as &quot;cows&quot;, carry the responsibility of childcare as males, referred to as &quot;bulls&quot;, play no part in raising calves.

Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, to prevent the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for a matter of months until the calf has developed enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk.{{sfn|Zerbini|2006|loc=[http://faculty.washington.edu/glennvb/fish475/Zerbini%20et%20al%202006%20published%20paper.pdf ''Megaptera novaeanglia''] pp.&amp;nbsp;295–304}} With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the [[tropics]] to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the [[southern right whale]], which migrates to [[Patagonia]] and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.{{sfn|Kennedy|2008|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;966}}

===Sleep===

Unlike most animals, whales are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, toothed cetaceans in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, so that they may swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.{{sfn|Miller et al.|2008|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23}}

A 2008 study found that sperm whales sleep in vertical postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do not respond to passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.{{sfn|Miller et al.|2008|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23}}

==Ecology==

===Foraging and predation===
{{See also|Beluga whale#Predation}}

[[File:Polar Bear ANWR 10.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polar bear]] with the remains of a [[beluga whale|beluga]]]]

All whales are carnivorous and predatory. Odontocetes, as a whole, mostly feed on fish and cephalopods, and then followed by crustaceans and bivalves. All species are generalist and opportunistic feeders. Mysticetes, as a whole, mostly feed on krill and plankton, followed by crustaceans and other invertebrates. A few are specialists. Examples include the blue whale, which eats almost exclusively krill, the minke whale, which eats mainly schooling fish, the [[sperm whale]], which specialize on squid, and the grey whale which feed on bottom-dwelling invertebrates.{{sfn|Goldbogen|2010}}{{sfn|Nemoto et al.|1988|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;292–296}}{{sfn|Lydersen et al.|1991|loc=[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1991.tb00655.x/abstract ''Balaenoptera acutorostrata'']}} The elaborate baleen &quot;teeth&quot; of filter-feeding species, mysticetes, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food by using the teeth as a sieve.{{sfn|Modern Marvels|2007}} Usually whales hunt solitarily, but they do sometimes hunt cooperatively in small groups. The former behaviour is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. When large amounts of prey are available, whales such as certain mysticetes hunt cooperatively in small groups.{{sfn|Defenders of Wildlife}} Some cetaceans may forage with other kinds of animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of [[pinnipeds]].{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;122–162}}{{sfn|Riedman|1991|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;168}}

Large whales, such as mysticetes, are not usually subject to predation, but smaller whales, such as monodontids or ziphiids, are. These species are preyed on by the [[killer whale]] or orca. To subdue and kill whales, orcas continuously ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times they corral the narwhals or belugas before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer orcas, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by orcas, but adults can be targeted as well.{{sfn|Morrel|2012}}

These small whales are also targeted by terrestrial and [[Pagophily|pagophilic]] predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears are known to use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive out of the reach of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.{{sfn|Smith et al.|1990|loc=[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic43-2-99.pdf ''Delphinapterus leucus''] pp.&amp;nbsp;99–102}}

A 2010 study considered whales to be a positive influence to the productivity of ocean fisheries, in what has been termed a &quot;whale pump.&quot; Whales carry nutrients such as nitrogen from the depths back to the surface. This functions as an upward biological pump, reversing an earlier presumption that whales accelerate the loss of nutrients to the bottom. This nitrogen input in the Gulf of Maine is &quot;more than the input of all rivers combined&quot; emptying into the gulf, some {{convert|23,000|MT|ST}} each year.{{sfn|ScienceDaily|2010}}{{sfn|Roman|2010b}}
[[Whale faeces|Whales defecate]] at the ocean's surface; their excrement is important for fisheries because it is rich in iron and nitrogen.

===Whale fall===
{{Main article|Whale fall}}
Upon death, whale carcasses fall to the deep ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other [[neritic]] biodiversity hotspots, such as [[cold seep]]s and [[hydrothermal vent]]s.{{sfn|Smith et al.|2003|loc=[http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/csmith/Files/Smith%20and%20Baco%202003.pdf The Whale Fall] pp.&amp;nbsp;311–354}}

Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though a series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as [[shark]]s and [[hagfish]], scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as [[crustaceans]] and [[polychaetes]], throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing [[hydrogen sulfide]] enabling the growth of [[chemoautotrophic]] organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.{{sfn|Smith et al.|2003|loc=[http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/oceanography/faculty/csmith/Files/Smith%20and%20Baco%202003.pdf The Whale Fall] pp.&amp;nbsp;311–354}}{{sfn|Fujiwara|2007|loc=[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0485.2007.00150.x/pdf The Whale Fall] pp.&amp;nbsp;219–230}}

[[File:Blue Whale population, Pengo.svg|thumb|right |World population graph of [[blue whale]]s|alt=Diagram showing blue whale population trend through the 1900s]]

[[Whaling]] by humans has existed since the [[Stone Age]]. Ancient whalers used [[harpoon]]s to spear the  bigger animals from boats out at sea.{{sfn|BBC|2004}} People from Norway and Japan started hunting whales around 2000 B.C.{{sfn|Morrero|2011}} Whales are typically hunted for their [[whale meat|meat]] and blubber by aboriginal groups; they used baleen for baskets or roofing, and made tools and masks out of bones.{{sfn|Morrero|2011}} The Inuit hunted whales in the Arctic Ocean.{{sfn|Morrero|2011}} The [[History of Basque whaling|Basques]] started whaling as early as the 11th century, sailing as far as [[Newfoundland]] in the 16th century in search of [[right whales]].{{sfn|Ford|2015}}{{sfn|Proulx|1994|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;260–286}} 18th- and 19th-century whalers hunted whales mainly for their [[whale oil|oil]], which was used as lamp fuel and a lubricant, [[baleen|baleen or whalebone]], which was used for items such as [[corset]]s and [[crinoline|skirt hoops]],{{sfn|Morrero|2011}} and [[ambergris]], which was used as a fixative for perfumes. The most successful whaling nations at this time were the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.{{sfn|New Bedford}}

Commercial whaling was historically important as an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling was at that time a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war.{{sfn|Stonehouse|2007}} By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone.{{sfn|Ford|2015}}{{sfn|Tonnessen|1982}} By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry.{{sfn|PBS}} Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.{{sfn|Economist|2012}}

Current whaling nations are Norway, Iceland, and Japan, despite their joining to the [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]], as well as the aboriginal communities of Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada.{{sfn|IFAW}} Subsistence hunters typically use whale products for themselves and depend on them for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of hunting are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as these aboriginal groups are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling whale products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term &quot;subsistence&quot; should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;13}}{{sfn|IWCa}}{{sfn|Morseth|1997}} In 1946, the IWC placed a moratorium, limiting the annual whale catch. Since then, yearly profits for these &quot;subsistence&quot; hunters have been close to US$31 million (UK£20m) per year.{{sfn|Economist|2012}}

===Other threats===
{{further information|Cetacean bycatch|Cetacean stranding}}

Whales can also be threatened by humans more indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries as [[bycatch]] and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. [[Gillnetting]] and [[Seine fishing|Seine netting]] is a significant cause of mortality in whales and other marine mammals.{{sfn|NOAAb}} Species commonly entangled include beaked whales. Whales are also affected by [[marine pollution]]. High levels of [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic chemical]]s accumulate in these animals since they are high in the food chain. They have large reserves of blubber, more so for toothed whales as they are higher up the food chain than baleen whales. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2012}} They can also be poisoned by swallowing litter, such as plastic bags.{{sfn|Tsai}} Environmentalists speculate that advanced naval [[sonar]] endangers some whales. Some scientists suggest that sonar may trigger [[Cetacean stranding|whale beaching]]s, and they point to signs that such whales have experienced [[decompression sickness]].{{sfn|Rommel|2006|loc=[http://foodweb.uhh.hawaii.edu/MARE390_files/Rommel%20et%20al.%202006.pdf Ziphiidae]}}{{sfn|Schrope|2003|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;106}}{{sfn|Kirby|2003}}{{sfn|Piantadosi et al.|2004}}

===Conservation===

[[File:International Whaling Commission members.svg|thumb|right|World map showing [[International Whaling Commission|International Whaling Commission (IWC)]] members in blue|alt=Map showing IWC members in blue]]

Whaling decreased substantially after 1946 when, in response to the steep decline in whale populations, the [[International Whaling Commission]] placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004.{{sfn|New Bedford}}{{sfn|IWCa}}{{sfn|IWCb}}{{sfn|IWCc|loc=[https://iwc.int/catches#comm Catches taken]}} As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 [[bowhead whales]] off of Alaska and two from the western coast of Greenland, 620 grey whales off Washington state, three [[common minke whale]]s off of the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 [[fin whales]] from the west coast of Greenland, nine [[humpback whale]]s from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off of [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] each year.{{sfn|IWCc|loc=[https://iwc.int/catches#comm Catches taken]}} Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the [[Gray whale#North Atlantic population|North Atlantic population]] is [[functionally extinct]]. Conversely, the North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.{{sfn|NOAAc|loc=[http://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/regs/2015/February/narwsourcedocumentfinal072114.pdf ''Eubalaena glacialis'']}}

The IWC has designated two whale sanctuaries: the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]], and the [[Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]. The Southern Ocean whale sanctuary spans {{convert|30560860|km2|sqmi}} and envelopes Antarctica.{{sfn|MacKenzie|1994}} The Indian Ocean whale sanctuary takes up all of the Indian Ocean south of 55°S.{{sfn|IWCd}} The IWC is a voluntary organization, with no treaty. Any nation may leave as they wish; the IWC cannot enforce any law it makes.

As of 2013, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) recognized 86 cetacean species, 40 of which are considered whales. Six are considered at risk, as they are ranked [[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]] (the North Atlantic right whale), &quot;[[Endangered species|Endangered]]&quot; (blue whale, fin whale, North Pacific right whale, and sei whale), and &quot;[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]&quot; (sperm whale). Twenty-one species have a &quot;[[Data Deficient]]&quot; ranking.{{sfn|Mead|2005|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;723–743}} Species that live in polar habitats are vulnerable to the effects of recent and ongoing [[climate change]], particularly the time when pack ice forms and melts.{{sfn|Laidre|2008|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;97–125}}

===Whale watching===
{{main article|Whale watching}}
[[Image:Whale Watching.jpg|thumb|[[Whale watching]] off [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbour, Maine]]]]

An estimated 13 million people went [[whale watching]] globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic.{{sfn|IFAW|2009}} Rules and codes of conduct have been created to minimize harassment of the whales.{{sfn|NOAA|2004}} Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists are concerned that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas.{{sfn|Björgvinsson|2002}} Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.{{sfn|O'Connor|2009}} In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year.{{sfn|Economist|2012}} The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the [[whaling|whaling industry]] about the best use of whales as a [[natural resource]].

===In myth, literature and art===
[[File:Im Februar 1598 an der holländischen Küste gestrandeter Walfisch.jpg|thumb|Engraving by [[William van der Gouwen]] depicting a stranded sperm whale being butchered on the Dutch coast, 1598]]
[[File:Oswald Brierly - Whalers off Twofold Bay, New South Wales, 1867.jpg|thumb|''Whalers off Twofold Bay, New South Wales''. [[Watercolour]] by [[Oswald Brierly]], 1867]]

As marine creatures that reside in either the depths or the poles, humans knew very little about whales over the course of [[history of the world|history]]; many feared or revered them. The [[Vikings|Nords]] and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were important pieces of their lives. In [[Inuit]] [[creation myth]]s, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the [[Great Spirit]] where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a [[fin whale]] and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.

Whales played a major part in shaping the art forms of many coastal civilizations, such as the [[Norsemen|Norse]], with some dating to the [[Stone Age]]. Petroglyphs off a cliff face in Bangudae, South Korea show 300 depictions of various animals, a third of which are whales. Some show particular detail in which there are throat pleats, typical of [[rorqual]]s. These petroglyphs show these people, of around 7,000 to 3,500 B.C.E. in South Korea, had a very high dependency on whales.{{sfn|CWA|2014}}

The [[Pacific Islanders]] and [[Australian Aborigines]] viewed whales as bringers of good and joy. One exception is [[French Polynesia]], where, in many parts, cetaceans are met with great brutality.{{sfn|Cressey|1998}}

In Vietnam and Ghana, among other places, whales hold a sense of divinity. They are so respected in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture.{{sfn|The Independent|2010}}{{sfn|AFP|2003}}{{sfn|Viegas|2010}}{{sfn|GNA|2005}} The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.

Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the [[Bible]]. It mentions whales in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:21, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] 7:12, and [[Ezekiel]] 32:2. The &quot;[[leviathan]]&quot; described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The &quot;sea monsters&quot; in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word &quot;jackals&quot; instead.{{sfn|Lamentations}}&lt;!-- &quot;sea monsters&quot; (marine mammals) in the Douay-Rheims, KJV, Webster, AKJV, and English Jubilee 2000 version - KJV margin &quot;sea calves&quot; (seals) --&gt; The story of [[Jonah in Islam|Jonah]] being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A [[medieval]] column [[capital (architecture)|capital]] sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in [[Mozac]], France.{{sfn|Quran}} The Old Testament contains the [[Book of Jonah]] and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 12:40.{{sfn|Matthew}}

In 1585, [[Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza|Alessandro Farnese]], 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of [[Antwerp]] by floats including &quot;Neptune and the Whale&quot;, indicating at least&lt;!--in John Mack's view--&gt; the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.{{sfn|Mack|2013}}

In 1896, an article in [[The Pall Mall Gazette]] popularised a practice of [[alternative medicine]] that probably began in the whaling town of [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]], [[Australia]] two or three years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;PallMallGazette&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = A New Cure for Rheumatism|date = 1896-03-07|accessdate = 2017-06-18|url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9805E2D71231E033A25754C0A9659C94679ED7CF|work = The Pall Mall Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SydneyMorningHerald&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Bizarre whale treatment for rheumatism revealed|date = 2014-03-30|accessdate = 2017-06-18|url = http://www.smh.com.au/environment/animals/bizarre-whale-treatment-for-rheumatism-revealed-20140329-35q0w.html|work = The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick]]'' features a &quot;great white whale&quot; as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale [[Mocha Dick]]. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]'' includes the story of &quot;How the Whale got in his Throat&quot;. [[Niki Caro]]'s film the ''[[Whale Rider]]'' has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288579743_The_whale_road_Transitioning_from_spiritual_links_to_whaling_to_whale_watching_in_Aotearoa_New_Zealand|title = The whale road: Transitioning from spiritual links, to whaling, to whale watching in Aotearoa New Zealand|last = Jøn|first = A.

Alan Hovhaness' orchestra ''And God Created Great Whales'' including the recorded sounds of humpback and bowhead whales.{{sfn|Hovhannes|1970}} [[Léo Ferré]]'s song &quot;[[Il n'y a plus rien]]&quot; is an example of [[biomusic#Whale song in music|biomusic]] that begins and ends with recorded [[Whale vocalization|whale songs]] mixed with a symphonic orchestra and his voice.

===In captivity===
{{Main article|Cetaceans in captivity}} 
{{Further information|Beluga whale#Captivity}}

[[File:WIKI SEA WORLD FL 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Beluga whale]]s and trainers in an aquarium]]

Belugas were the first whales to be kept in captivity. Other species were too rare, too shy, or too big. The first beluga was shown at [[Barnum's American Museum|Barnum's Museum]] in [[New York City]] in 1861.{{sfn|NYT|1861}} For most of the 20th century, Canada was the predominant source of wild belugas.{{sfn|CMEPS|2006}} They were taken from the St. Lawrence River estuary until the late 1960s, after which they were predominantly taken from the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] estuary until capture was banned in 1992.{{sfn|CMEPS|2006}} Russia has become the largest provider since it had been banned in Canada.{{sfn|CMEPS|2006}} Belugas are caught in the Amur River delta and their eastern coast, and then are either transported domestically to aquariums or [[dolphinarium]]s in [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], and [[Sochi]], or exported to other countries, such as Canada.{{sfn|CMEPS|2006}} Most captive belugas are caught in the wild, since captive-breeding programs are not very successful.{{sfn|WAZA}}

As of 2006, 30 belugas were in Canada and 28 in the United States, and 42 deaths in captivity had been reported up to that time.{{sfn|CMEPS|2006}} A single specimen can reportedly fetch up to US$100,000 (UK£64,160) on the market. The beluga's popularity is due to its unique colour and its [[facial expression]]s. The latter is possible because while most cetacean &quot;smiles&quot; are fixed, the extra movement afforded by the beluga's unfused cervical vertebrae allows a greater range of apparent expression.{{sfn|Bonner}}

Between 1960 and 1992, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] carried out a program that included the study of marine mammals' abilities with [[Animal echolocation|sonar]], with the objective of improving the detection of underwater objects. A large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins.{{sfn|Bonner}}{{sfn|PBSb}} The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras in their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and [[submarine]]s, and underwater monitoring.{{sfn|PBSb}} A similar program was used by the [[Russian Navy]] during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for [[Naval mine|antimining]] operations in the Arctic.{{sfn|Beland|1996}}

Aquariums have tried housing other species of whales in captivity. The success of belugas turned attention to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, in captivity. However, in repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept in captivity died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} tank was not big enough.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;279}} There have been attempts to keep baleen whales in captivity. There were three attempts to keep grey whales in captivity. Gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport. Gigi II was another grey whale calf that was captured in the [[Ojo de Liebre Lagoon]], and was transported to [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]].{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;372–373}} The {{convert|680|kg|lbs|adj=on}} calf was a popular attraction, and behaved normally, despite being separated from his mother. A year later, the {{convert|8,000|kg|lbs|adj=on}} whale grew too big to keep in captivity and was released; it was the first of two grey whales, the other being another grey whale calf named JJ, to successfully be kept in captivity.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=pp.&amp;nbsp;372–373}} There were three attempts to keep minke whales in captivity in Japan. They were kept in a tidal pool with a [[waterway|sea-gate]] at the Izu Mito Sea Paradise. Another, unsuccessful, attempt was made by the U.S. {{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;383}} One stranded humpback whale calf was kept in captivity for rehabilitation, but died days later.{{sfn|Klinowska et al.|1991a|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;421}}

'''Cetacean stranding''', commonly known as '''beaching''', is a phenomenon in which [[cetacean]]s strand themselves on land, usually on a [[beach]]. Beached whales often die due to [[dehydration]], collapsing under their own weight, or drowning when high tide covers the [[blowhole (biology)|blowhole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Blood| first=Matt D. | title=Beached Whales: A Personal Encounter| year=2012|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several explanations of the stranding have been proposed.

==Species==
{{See also|List of sperm whale strandings}}
[[File:1986 beached whales in Flinders Bay (2).JPG|thumb|left|Beached [[false killer whale]]s at [[Flinders Bay, Western Australia]], 1986.]]
Every year, up to 2,000 animals beach themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin&quot;&gt;
{{cite book| last=Martin| first=Anthony R. | title=Whales and Dolphins| year=1991| publisher=Salamander Books Ltd. |location=London| isbn=0-8160-3922-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of strandings result in death, they pose no threat to any species as a whole. Only about 10 [[cetacea]]n species frequently display mass beachings, with 10 more rarely doing so.

All frequently involved species are [[toothed whale]]s (Odontoceti), rather than [[baleen whale]]s (Mysticeti). These species share some characteristics which may explain why they beach.

Body size does not normally affect the frequency, but both the animals' normal habitat and social organization do appear to influence their chances of coming ashore in large numbers. Odontocetes that normally inhabit deep waters and live in large, tightly knit groups are the most susceptible. This includes the [[sperm whale]], oceanic dolphins, usually [[pilot whale|pilot]] and [[killer whale]]s, and a few [[beaked whale]] species.

Solitary species naturally do not strand en masse. Cetaceans that spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters almost never mass strand.

==Causes==
[[File:Three Beached Whales, 1577.jpg|thumb|right|''Three Beached Whales'', a 1577 engraving by the Flemish artist [[Jan Wierix]], depicts stranded Sperm Whales.  Note the incorrectly recorded &quot;nostril&quot; and correctly extruded penis.]]
Strandings can be grouped into several types. The most obvious distinctions are between single and multiple strandings. The carcasses of deceased cetaceans are likely to float to the surface at some point; during this time, [[Ocean current|current]]s or [[wind]]s may carry them to  a [[coastline]]. Since thousands of cetaceans die every year, many become stranded posthumously. Most carcasses never reach the coast and are [[Scavenger|scavenged]] or [[Decomposition|decomposed]] enough to sink to the ocean bottom, where the carcass forms the basis of a unique local ecosystem called [[whale fall]]. Single live strandings are often the result of illness or injury, which almost inevitably end in death in the absence of human intervention.
Multiple strandings in one place are rare and often attract media coverage as well as rescue efforts. Even multiple offshore deaths are unlikely to lead to multiple strandings due to variable winds and currents.

A key factor in many of these cases appears to be the strong social cohesion of toothed whales. If one gets into trouble, its distress calls may prompt the rest of the pod to follow and beach themselves alongside.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-mystery&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many theories, some of them controversial, have been proposed to explain beaching, but the question remains unresolved.

===Natural===
[[File:The-whale-beached-1617.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Whale Beached between [[Scheveningen]] and [[Katwijk]], with Elegant Sightseers,&quot; by [[Esaias van den Velde]], c.1617]]
[[Whale]]s have beached throughout human history, so many strandings can be attributed to natural and environmental factors, such as rough weather, weakness due to old age or infection, difficulty giving birth,&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-mystery&quot; /&gt; hunting too close to shore, or navigation errors.

In 2004, scientists at the [[University of Tasmania]] linked whale strandings and weather, hypothesizing that when cool [[Antarctic]] waters rich in [[squid]] and [[fish]] flow north, whales follow their prey closer towards land.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-climate&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|author1=R. Gales |author2=K. Evans |author3=M. Hindell |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1255082.htm

|title=Whale strandings no surprise to climatologists
|work=7:30 report|date=2004-11-30|accessdate=2006-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases predators (such as killer whales) have been known to panic other whales, herding them towards the shoreline.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc-climate&quot; /&gt;

Their [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] system can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;fatal shore&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|author=B. Montgomery|title=The fatal shore
|url=http://www.biophysics.uwa.edu.au/Bioacoustics/waustralian.html
|work=The Weekend Australian Magazine
|date=1998-05-02
|accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory accounts for mass beaching hot spots such as [[Ocean Beach, Tasmania]] and [[Geographe Bay, Western Australia]] where the slope is about half a degree (approximately {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr =on}} deep {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr =on}} out to sea). The [[University of Western Australia]] [[Bioacoustics]] group proposes that repeated reflections between the surface and ocean bottom in gently-sloping shallow water may [[attenuate]] sound so much that the echo is inaudible to the whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;uwa-acoustics&quot;&gt;
{{cite conference|author1=Chambers S. |author2=James R. N. |title=Sonar termination as a cause of mass cetacean strandings in Geographe Bay, south-western Australia|booktitle=Acoustics 2005, Acoustics in a Changing Environment.

=== &quot;Follow-me&quot; strandings ===
Some strandings may be caused by larger cetaceans following [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]] into shallow coastal waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The larger animals may habituate to following faster-moving dolphins. If they encounter an adverse combination of [[tidal flow]] and [[seabed topography]], the larger species may become trapped.

Sometimes following a dolphin can help a whale escape danger. In 2008, a local dolphin was followed out to open water by two [[Pygmy sperm whale]]s that had become lost behind a sandbar at [[Mahia Beach]], New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolphin rescues stranded whales |work=CNN |publisher=The Associated Press |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/nz.whales.ap/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313191401/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/12/nz.whales.ap/index.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be possible to train dolphins to lead trapped whales out to sea.

Pods of [[killer whale]]s, predators of dolphins and porpoises, very rarely strand. It may be that heading for shallow waters protects the smaller animals from predators and that killer whales have learned to stay away. Alternatively, killer whales have learned how to operate in shallow waters, particularly in their pursuit of seals. The latter  is certainly the case in [[Península Valdés]], Argentina, and the [[Crozet Islands]] of the Indian Ocean, where killer whales pursue seals up shelving gravel beaches to the edge of the littoral zone. The pursuing dolphins are occasionally partially thrust out of the sea by a combination of their own impetus and retreating water and have to wait for the next wave to carry them back to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Robin W.: ''Killer Whales of the World'' Voyageur Press, Stillwater, MN, 2002, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sonar===
{{see also|Noise pollution|Marine mammals and sonar}}
[[File:Whales on beach, Farewell Split, South Island, New Zealand.JPG|thumb|right|Volunteers attempt to keep body temperatures of beached pilot whales from rising at [[Farewell Spit]], [[New Zealand]].]]
There is evidence that [[active sonar]] leads to beaching. On some occasions cetaceans have stranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area, suggesting a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last=US Dept of Commerce |author2=Secretary of the Navy |title=Joint Interim Report – Bahamas Marine Mammal Stranding Event of 15–16 March 2000 |date=2001-12|url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/acoustics/bahamas_stranding.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories describing how sonar may cause whale deaths have also been advanced after [[necropsies]] found internal injuries in stranded cetaceans. In contrast, some who strand themselves due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy prior to beaching:

{{quote|The low frequency active sonar (LFA sonar) used by the military to detect submarines is the loudest sound ever put into the seas. Yet the U.S. Navy is planning to deploy LFA sonar across 80 percent of the world ocean. At an amplitude of two hundred forty decibels, it is loud enough to kill whales and dolphins and has already caused mass strandings and deaths in areas where U.S. and/or NATO forces have conducted exercises.|Julia Whitty|The Fragile Edge&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/booksellers/press_release/whitty/ ''The Fragile Edge: Diving and Other Adventures in the South Pacific'', Julia Whitty. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 50; see also [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002V1GZN2 page 50 at Amazon.com].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The large and rapid pressure changes made by loud sonar can cause [[hemorrhaging]].

Another means by which sonar could be hurting cetaceans is a form of [[decompression sickness]]. This was first raised by necrological examinations of 14 [[beaked whale]]s stranded in the [[Canary Islands]]. The stranding happened on 24 September 2002, close to the operating area of [[Neo Tapon]] (an international naval exercise) about four hours after the activation of mid-frequency sonar.&lt;ref name=&quot;jepson-2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.

It could be due to cetaceans panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt to escape the sonar pulses. There is also a theoretical basis by which sonar vibrations can cause supersaturated gas to [[nucleate]], forming bubbles (cavitation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. S. Houser |author2=R.

The overwhelming majority of the cetaceans involved in sonar-associated beachings are [[Cuvier's beaked whale]]s (''Ziphius cavirostrus''). This species strands frequently, but mass strandings are rare. They are so difficult to study in the wild that prior to the interest raised by the sonar controversy, most of the information about them came from stranded animals. The first to publish research linking beachings with naval activity were Simmonds and Lopez-Jurado in 1991. They noted that over the past decade there had been a number of mass strandings of beaked whales in the Canary Islands, and each time the [[Spanish Navy]] was conducting exercises. Conversely, there were no mass strandings at other times. They did not propose a theory for the strandings. A letter to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Fernández ''et al.'' in 2013 reported that there had been no further mass strandings in that area following a 2004 ban by the Spanish government on military exercises in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fernández | first1 = A. | last2 = Arbelo | first2 = M. | last3 = Martín | first3 = V. | doi = 10.1038/497317d | title = Whales: No mass strandings since sonar ban | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7449 | pages = 317 | year = 2013 | pmid =  23676745| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1996, there was another mass stranding in West [[Peloponnese]], [[Greece]]. At the time, it was noted as &quot;atypical&quot; both because mass strandings of beaked whales are rare, and also because the stranded whales were spread over such a long stretch of coast with each individual whale spatially separated from the next stranding. At the time of the incident, there was no connection made with active sonar; the marine biologist investigating the incident, Dr. Frantzis, made the connection to sonar because he discovered a notice to Mariners about the test. His scientific correspondence in &quot;Nature&quot; titled &quot;Does acoustic testing strand whales?&quot; was published in March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pelagosinstitute.gr/en/pelagos/index3.html |title=Does acoustic testing strand whales? |last=Frantzis |first=A |journal=Nature |date=1988-03-05 |volume=392 |pages=29 |doi=10.1038/32068 |pmid=9510243 |issue=6671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Peter Tyack, of [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], has been researching noise's effects on marine mammals since the 1970s. He has led much of the recent research on beaked whales (Cuvier's beaked whales in particular). Data tags have shown that Cuvier's dive considerably deeper than previously thought, and are in fact the deepest diving species of marine mammal. Their surfacing behavior is highly unusual because they exert considerable physical effort to surface in a controlled ascent, rather than simply floating to the surface like sperm whales. Deep dives are followed by three or four shallow dives. Vocalization stops at shallow depths, because of fear of predators or because they don't need vocalization to stay together at depths where there is sufficient light to see each other. The elaborate dive patterns are assumed to be necessary to control the diffusion of gases in the bloodstream. No data show a beaked whale making an uncontrolled ascent or failing to do successive shallow dives.

==Disposal==

If a whale is beached near an inhabited locality, the rotting carcass can pose a nuisance as well as a health risk. Such very large [[Dead body|corpse]]s are difficult to move. The whales are often towed back out to sea away from shipping lanes, allowing them to decompose naturally, or they are towed out to sea and blown up with explosives. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in [[South Africa]], [[Iceland]], [[Australia]] and [[Exploding whale|Oregon, United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6lTSxJvR4w|title=Exploding Whale - Whale Of A Tale|first=|last=implosionworld|date=29 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mbl&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Hvalhræ dregið út á haf og síðan aftur upp í fjöru  | trans_title=Whale pulled out to sea and then back up the beach | work=[[Morgunblaðið|mbl.is]] | language=Icelandic | url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/frett.html?nid=1142126 | date=June 5, 2005 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-09-02/explosive-end-for-sick-whale/2246266 | title=Explosive end for sick whale | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | date=September 2, 2010 | accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the carcass is older, it is buried.

In New Zealand, which is the site of many whale strandings, treaties with the indigenous [[Māori people]] allow for the tribal gathering and customary (that is, traditional) use of whalebone from any animal which has died as a result of stranding. Whales are regarded as [[taonga]] (spiritual treasure) as being descendants of the ocean god, [[Tangaroa]], and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as [[tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] sites, that is, they are regarded as sacred ground.&lt;ref&gt;Te Karaka, &quot;[http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/our_stories/science-strandings/ The science of strandings]', Te Rūnanga o [[Ngāi Tahu]], 21 December 2014.

== Health risks ==
A beached whale [[Cadaver|carcass]] should not be consumed. In 2002, fourteen [[Alaska]]ns ate ''[[muktuk]]'' (whale blubber) from a beached whale, resulting in eight of them developing [[botulism]], with two of the affected requiring [[mechanical ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Large strandings==
In 1918, approximately 1000 [[pilot whale]]s stranded on the Chatham Islands, the largest whale stranding in recorded history.

In 1985 about 450 pilot whales were stranded in Auckland, New Zealand.

On June 23, 2015, 337 dead whales were discovered in a remote [[fiord|fjord]] in the [[Patagonia]], southern [[Chile]], which was the largest stranding of [[baleen whale]]s to date. 305 bodies and 32 skeletons were identified by aerial and satellite photography between the [[Gulf of Penas]] and [[Puerto Natales]], near the southern tip of [[South America]].  The whales may be [[sei whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 337 Whales Beached in Largest Stranding Ever|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151120-worlds-largest-whale-stranding-sei-chile-animals/|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-11-21|first = Brian Clark|last = Howard|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED November|last2 = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of only two or three such baleen mass stranding events in the last hundred years. It is highly unusual for baleens to strand other than singly, and the Patagonia baleen strandings are tentatively attributed to an unusual cause such as ingestion of poisonous algae.

On the morning of February 10, 2017, more than 416 pilot whales were discovered on a crescent of land on New Zealand’s South Island called [[Farewell Spit]] in Golden Bay at the top of the South Island, with more than 70% dead by dawn.  An additional 240 whales stranded themselves late on February 11. This brought the total number of stranded pilot whales to 656, making this the second-largest whale stranding event in recorded history. About 335 of the whales were declared dead out of which 20 had to be euthanized, 200 re-floated themselves at high tide and a few were brought back to sea with human effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/11/514677975/as-200-more-whales-are-stranded-in-new-zealand-heroics-turn-to-heartbreak|title=As 200 More Whales Are Stranded In New Zealand, Heroics Turn To Heartbreak|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/more-than-330-pilot-whales-die-in-new-zealand-mass-stranding|title=Hope for end to New Zealand whale strandings after 350 die|first1=Melissa|last1=Davey|first2=|last2=agencies|date=11 February 2017|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-38942763|title=New Zealand whales: Hundreds refloat on high tide at Farewell Spit|date=12 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:020904whale 210.jpg|right|thumb|Dynamite was used to blow up a rotting [[beached whale]], with unintended consequences.]]
The term '''exploding whale''' primarily refers to an event at [[Florence, Oregon]] in November 1970, when a dead [[sperm whale]] (reported to be a [[gray whale]]) was blown up by the [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon Highway Division]] in an attempt to dispose of its rotting carcass. The explosion threw whale flesh over {{convert|800|ft|m|-1}} away. This incident became famous in the United States when American humorist [[Dave Barry]] wrote about it in his newspaper column after viewing a videotape of television footage of the explosion. The event became well-known internationally a few decades later when the same footage circulated on the Internet. It was also parodied in the 2007 movie ''[[Reno 911!: Miami]]''.

There have also been examples of spontaneously exploding whales. The most widely reported example was in [[Taiwan]] in 2004, when the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to explode in a crowded urban area while it was being transported for a [[autopsy|post-mortem examination]].

At the time, Oregon beaches were under the jurisdiction of the state's Highway Division which, after consulting with the United States Navy, decided to remove the whale in the same way as they would a boulder{{snd}}using dynamite{{snd}}assuming that the resulting pieces would be small enough for [[scavenger]]s to clear up.

A military veteran with explosives training who happened to be in the area&lt;ref name=&quot;offbeatoregon.com&quot;/&gt; warned that the planned twenty cases of dynamite was far too much{{snd}}20 ''sticks'' would have sufficed{{snd}}but his advice went unheeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;offbeatoregon.com&quot;/&gt;

The dynamite was detonated on November 12 at 3:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;oreg-2013oct31&quot;/&gt;  The resulting explosion was caught on film by cameraman Doug Brazil for a story reported by news reporter Paul Linnman of [[KATU]]-TV in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In his voice-over, Linnman joked that &quot;land-lubber newsmen&quot; became &quot;land-''blubber'' newsmen&amp;nbsp;... for the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;linnmantranscript&quot;/&gt; The explosion caused large pieces of blubber to land near buildings and in parking lots some distance away from the beach. Only some of the whale was disintegrated; most of it remained on the beach for the OHD workers to clear away. In his report, Linnman also noted that scavenger birds, whom it had been hoped would eat the remains of the carcass after the explosion, did not appear as they were possibly scared away by the noise.

Ending his story, Linnman noted that &quot;It might be concluded that, should a whale ever be washed ashore in [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] again, those in charge will not only remember what to do, they'll certainly remember what ''not'' to do.&quot; When 41 sperm whales beached nearby in 1979, state parks officials burned and buried them.&lt;ref name=&quot;transcriptwhaledisposal&quot;&gt;

===Renewed interest===
The story was brought to widespread public attention by popular writer [[Dave Barry]] in his ''[[Miami Herald]]'' column of May 20, 1990, when he reported that he possessed footage of the event. Barry wrote, &quot;Here at the [Exploding Animal Research] Institute we watch it often, especially at parties.&quot; Some time later, the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on bulletin boards under the title &quot;[[The Far Side]] Comes to Life in Oregon&quot;. The unattributed copy of Barry's article did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty-five years earlier. Barry later said that, on a fairly regular basis, someone would forward him the &quot;authorless&quot; column and suggest he write something about the described incident.&lt;ref&gt;

As a result of these omissions, an article in the ODOT's ''TranScript'' notes that,

{{quote|&quot;We started getting calls from curious reporters across the country right after the electronic bulletin board story appeared,&quot; said Ed Schoaps, public affairs coordinator for the Oregon Department of Transportation. &quot;They thought the whale had washed ashore recently, and were hot on the trail of a governmental blubber flub-up. They were disappointed that the story has twenty five years of dust on it.&quot;

Schoaps has fielded calls from reporters and the just plain curious in Oregon, [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Massachusetts]]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called, and Washington, D.C.-based ''Governing'' magazine covered the immortal legend of the beached whale in its June issue. And the phone keeps ringing. &quot;I get regular calls about this story,&quot; Schoaps said. His phone has become the blubber hotline for ODOT, he added. &quot;It amazes me that people are still calling about this story after nearly twenty five years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes&quot;/&gt;

==Tainan City, Taiwan==
Another well-known explosion occurred on January 26, 2004, in [[Tainan City]], Taiwan, this time from a natural cause: the buildup of gas inside a decomposing sperm whale caused it to burst. The explosion was initially mysterious, since it unexpectedly occurred in the spine of the whale. It was later determined that the whale had most likely been struck by a large shipping vessel, damaging its spine, and leading to its death. The whale died after beaching on the southwestern coast of Taiwan, and it took three large cranes and 50 workers more than 13 hours to shift the whale onto the back of a truck.

''[[Taiwan News]]'' reported that, while the whale was being moved, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a large crowd of more than 600 local Yunlin residents and curiosity seekers, along with vendors selling snack food and hot drinks, braved the cold temperature and chilly wind to watch workmen try to haul away the dead marine leviathan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jasonpan&quot;&gt;

Professor Wang Chien-ping had ordered the whale be moved to the Sutsao Wild Life Reservation Area after he had been refused permission to perform an [[autopsy]] at the [[National Cheng Kung University]] in Tainan. When it exploded, the whale was on the back of a truck near the center of Tainan, ''en route'' from the university laboratory to the preserve.

The bursting whale splattered blood and entrails over surrounding shop fronts, bystanders, and cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbctaiwaneselocal&quot;&gt;

[[File:Whale fall.jpg|thumb|Skeleton of a 35-ton, 13-m [[gray whale]] that has been on the seafloor of the Santa Cruz Basin (around 1700 m deep) for 18 months. Animals visible include multiple eel-like [[hagfish]], thousands of [[amphipod]]s and newly settled, juvenile [[clams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;]]
A '''whale fall''' is the [[Cadaver|carcass]] of a [[cetacea]]n that has fallen into the [[Bathyal zone|bathyal]] or [[abyssal zone]] (i.e. deeper than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x|, or }}) on the ocean floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot; /&gt; They can create complex localized [[ecosystem]]s that supply sustenance to deep-sea organisms for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lloyd2007&quot; /&gt; This is unlike in [[Mesopelagic zone|shallower waters]], where a whale carcass will be consumed by [[scavenger]]s over a relatively short period of time. It was with the development of [[Deep-sea exploration|deep-sea robotic exploration]] that whale falls were first observed in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCB&quot; /&gt;

Organisms that have been observed at deep-sea whale falls include [[giant isopod]]s, [[squat lobster]]s, [[Polychaete|bristleworms]], [[prawn]]s, [[shrimp]], [[lobster]]s, [[hagfish]], ''[[Osedax]]'', [[crabs]], [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s, and [[sleeper shark]]s.

Whale falls are able to occur in the deep open ocean due to cold temperatures and high hydrostatic pressures.  In the coastal ocean, a higher incidence of predators as well as warmer waters hasten the decomposition of whale carcasses.  Carcasses may also float due to decompositional gases, keeping the carcass at the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;allison1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allison|first1=Peter A.|last2=Smith|first2=Craig R.|last3=Kukert|first3=Helmut|last4=Deming|first4=Jody W.|last5=Bennett|first5=Bruce A.|title=Deep-water taphonomy of vertebrate carcasses: a whale skeleton in the bathyal Santa Catalina Basin|journal=Paleobiology|date=1991|volume=17|issue=1|pages=78–89|doi=10.1017/S0094837300010368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the deep-sea, cold temperatures slow decomposition rates, and high hydrostatic pressures increase gas solubility, allowing food falls to remain intact and sink to great depths.&lt;ref name=&quot;allison1991&quot; /&gt;

There have also been studies based on the carcasses of other, non-mammalian marine vertebrates that have fallen to the deep sea.  In particular, the chance discovery of a [[whale shark]] carcass and three [[mobulid]] ray carcasses led to observations on the communities that form surrounding large [[Elasmobranchii|elasmobranch]] falls as opposed to whale falls.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgs|first1=Nicholas D.|last2=Gates|first2=Andrew R.|last3=Jones|first3=Daniel O.

Another theory suggests that the eelpouts were waiting for their main prey, [[amphipods]] and other small benthic animals.  The three rays found were at varying stages of decomposition, leading to varying assemblages found surrounding the individuals.  A higher abundance of scavengers was found surrounding the more intact individuals, including scavengers typical of whale falls like [[hagfish]].  Around the least intact individual a [[bacterial mat]] was observed in the zone of enrichment, but no clams or mussels typical of this environment (i.e. whale falls) were seen.

Overall, the four carcasses observed showed no evidence of progression past the scavenger stage (Stage 1 below).  The size limitations, as well as physiological differences between large elasmobranchs and whales more than likely causes the changes observed in the communities surrounding their respective carcasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgs&quot; /&gt;  Osedax worms have the ability to extract collagen from bones as well as lipids, enabling them to sustain themselves on bones other than the lipid-rich remains of whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=William J.|last2=Johnson|first2=Shannon B.|last3=Rouse|first3=Greg W.|last4=Vrijenhoek|first4=Robert C.|title=Marine worms (genus ''Osedax'') colonize cow bones|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2008|volume=275|issue=1633|pages=387–391|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1437|pmid=18077256|pmc=2596828}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although no Osedax were found on the non-mammalian remains in this study, their absence may have been due to the timing of observation, and the Osedax had not yet colonized the carcasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;higgs&quot; /&gt;  Various studies on smaller cetaceans and other marine vertebrate food falls come to similar conclusions that these falls bring a large amount of new organic material to depth, but support mostly a scavenger community, as opposed to the diverse assemblage seen at whale falls.  This conclusion can be drawn based on the knowledge that large whales have much higher [[lipid]] content in their bulk composition and bone marrow, which supports the diverse communities present in succession at whale falls. (Witte, 1999; Janssen et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2006; Higgs et al., 2014).{{Synthesis inline|date=November 2016}}

== Contribution to the Biological Pump ==

The amount of [[carbon]] tied up in a typical single whale carcass (about two [[metric ton]]s of carbon for a typical forty-ton carcass) is roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon exported to a hectare of abyssal ocean floor in 100–200 years.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. R., &amp; Baco, A. R. (2003). Ecology of whale falls at the deep-sea floor. Oceanography and Marine Biology, Vol 41, 41, 311–354.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This amount of organic material reaching the seafloor at one time creates a pulse equivalent to about 2000 years of background carbon flux in the 50 square metres of sediment immediately beneath the whale fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ecology of whale falls at the deep-sea floor|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=16357030|journal=Oceanography and marine biology|volume=41|issn=0078-3218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This helps to sustain the community structure that develops around a whale fall, but it also has potential implications for the biological pump, or the flux of organic material from the surface ocean to depth. Whales and some other large marine animals feed on and follow large aggregations of zooplankton for sustenance. Based on simple trophic structure, this would mean whales and other large zooplankton feeders can be found at higher abundance around areas of high primary production, potentially making them important exporters of carbon to depth through food falls. (Higgs et al., 2014).  Biological pump models indicate that a large amount of carbon uptake by the deep sea is not supplied by particulate organic carbon (POC) alone, and must come from another source. Lateral advection of carbon, especially in coastal areas contributes to this deficit in the model, but food falls are also another source of organic carbon for the deep ocean (Higgs et al., 2014).  Various percentages of the food fall contribution to the total carbon flux to the deep ocean have been hypothesized, ranging from 0.3% (Smith 2006) to 4% (Higgs et al., 2014).  There is growing evidence that the contribution of food falls to the deep ocean carbon flux is larger than originally proposed, especially on the local scale in areas of high primary productivity.  Unfortunately, contributions of food falls to the biological pump are hard to measure and rely on a few serendipitous studies on discovered falls (Smith et al., 1989; Higgs et al., 2014) as well as planted carcasses (Janssen et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2009), with much of the deep sea carbon flux studies relying on sediment traps (Robison et al., 2005; Miller and Wheeler, 2012).  One study even suggested that the whaling industry has had an effect on the biological pump through the elimination of many large whales, as well as a large number of whales, reducing the amount of whale falls (Pershing et al., 2010).

== Discovery ==
[[File:Sample collecting at whale fall.jpg|thumb|The skeleton of a gray whale lies on the [[Monterey Bay|Santa Cruz Basin]] seafloor as a [[hagfish]] swims into view of the [[US Navy]]'s [[Deep-submergence vehicle|deep-sea submersible]] [[DSV Alvin|ALVIN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;]]
The earliest indication that whale carcasses could host specialized animal communities occurred in 1854 when a new [[mussel]] species was extracted from a piece of floating whale [[blubber]]. By the 1960s, deep sea trawlers unintentionally recovered other new [[mollusc]] species including [[limpet]]s (named ''[[Osteopelta]]'') attached to whale bones.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

The first recorded abyssal whale fall was discovered by Navy [[bathyscaph]] pilots LT Ken Hanson, Master Chief George Ellis and LT Tom Vetter diving in bathyscaph [[Trieste II]] (DSV-1) on 19 February 1977  (at {{nowrap|{{coord|33|13.0|N|118|32.5|W|display=inline|scale:3000000}}}}). The skeleton of the carcass, which was completely devoid of organic tissue, remained intact and collapsed flat on the seafloor. The submersible recovered a jawbone and phalanges. The whale was considered to be a [[gray whale]] based on the size of the bones and the skeleton, the lack of teeth and its location west of Santa Catalina.&lt;ref name=&quot;trieste&quot; /&gt;

Another whale fall was discovered accidentally by a team of [[marine biologist]]s led by [[University of Hawaii]] [[oceanography|oceanographer]] Craig Smith in 1987. The [[DSV Alvin]] identified the remains using [[scanning sonar]] at {{convert|1240|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Santa Catalina, California|Catalina]] Basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

Other whale falls have since been found by more researchers and deep-sea explorers as well as naval [[submarine]]s. The increase in detection is largely due to the use of cutting-edge [[side-scan sonar]] which can minutely examine the ocean floor for large aggregations of matter.

== Organisms ==
[[File:Whale fall Whale bone recovery.jpg|thumb|A [[whale bone]] being recovered from the Santa Catalina Basin floor five years after experimental emplacement. The bone surface contains patches of white bacterial mats and a [[squat lobster]]. [[Hydroids]] have sprouted on the loop of yellow line attached to the bone.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot; /&gt;]]
A consistent group of organisms inhabits whale falls in all oceans. The mussels and [[Vesicomyidae|vesicomyid clam]]s from Alvin's discovery belonged to groups that harbor [[chemosynthetic]] bacteria which can draw energy from [[inorganic chemicals]]. Their only known habitats were sunken wood and [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The [[Lucinidae|lucinid clams]]' only other habitats were seeps and [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] seafloor sediments. Similarly, a snail inhabited only anoxic sediments.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

Similar ecosystems exist when other large volumes of nutrient-rich material fall to the sea floor. Sunken beds of [[kelp]] create kelp falls, and large trees can sink to create wood falls. In more recent years, [[shipwrecks]] have also provided bases for deepwater communities.

=== Ecosystem stages ===
Scientists have concluded from the data recorded from Santa Catalina, as well as other cases off the California coast, that there are at least three stages of decomposition associated with a whale fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

The initial period begins with &quot;mobile scavengers&quot; such as [[hagfish]] and [[sleeper shark]]s actively consuming soft tissue from the carcass. Consumption can be at a rate of {{convert|40|-|60|kg|lb}} per day over a two-year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

====Stage 2====
The second stage introduces the &quot;enrichment opportunists&quot;. These are animals which colonize the bones and surrounding sediments that have been contaminated with organic matter from the carcass and any other tissue left by the scavengers. This process can take up to two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

====Stage 3====
[[File:Whalefall hires.jpg|thumb|A chemoautotrophic whale-fall community, including bacteria mats, vesicomyid clams in the sediments, galatheid crabs, polynoids, and a variety of other invertebrates.]]
Finally &quot;[[Chemotroph|sulfophilic bacteria]]&quot; anaerobically break down the [[lipid]]s embedded in the bones. Instead of [[oxygen]], they reduce dissolved sulfate {{chem|SO|4 |2-}} and excrete [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Due to the toxicity of {{chem|H|2|S}}, only resistant chemosynthetic bacteria survive. The [[bacterial mat]]s provide nourishment for mussels, clams, limpets and sea snails. As whale bones are rich in lipids, representing 4–6% of its body weight, the final digestion stage can last between 50 and possibly 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

A process called methanogenesis can also occur around whale falls.  Archaea that produce methane can be abundant in anoxic sediment, but is typically not found in co-occurrence with the sulfur reducing bacteria found at whale falls.  Whale falls do however support both sulfur reducing bacteria and methane producing archaea, leading to the conclusion that the area is not electron donor limited, and/or there is minimal or no competition for suitable substrate.  Concentration gradients of both sulfide and methane can be found around whale falls, with the highest concentration coming within one meter of the carcass, which is several orders of magnitude higher than the surrounding sediment concentrations.  Methanogenesis appears to only occur in sediments as opposed to sulfur reduction, which occurs both in sediments and on the bones of the carcass.  The addition of sulfur reduction in both sediments and high lipid whale bones is a key factor for why whale falls are able to sustain deep-sea communities for extended periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treude|first1=Tina|last2=Smith|first2=Craig R.|last3=Wenzhöfer|first3=Frank|last4=Carney|first4=Erin|last5=Bernardino|first5=Angelo F.|last6=Hannides|first6=Angelos K.|last7=Krüger|first7=Martin|last8=Boetius|first8=Antje|title=Biogeochemistry of a deep-sea whale fall: sulfate reduction, sulfide efflux and methanogenesis|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|date=2009|volume=382|pages=1–21|doi=10.3354/meps07972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variance in decomposition rates ===
The differences in stage patterns between whale falls is likely to be related to carcass size. Large, intact whale falls appear to pass through the three decomposition stages, while the stages on smaller or partial carcasses may be truncated. Researchers believe the presence of {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} ''[[Osedax]]'' ([[Latin]]: bone-devourer) may be a contributing factor in the successional differences. Also known as zombie worms—so called because they have no eyes or mouth—they were first discovered in the deep [[Submarine canyon|Submarine]] [[Monterey Canyon]] off central California in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/5861-strange-worms-discovered-eating-dead-whales.html|title=Strange Worms Discovered Eating Dead Whales|publisher=livescience.com|date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples have since been discovered off [[Sweden]], [[Japan]], and [[Antarctica]]. ''Osedax'' larvae have no digestive tract; instead they float through the oceans until they encounter a carcass. The worms then grow appendages resembling tiny trees that absorb oxygen. A root-like structure grows into the bone; these contain [[symbiotic]] bacteria which make an acid that breaks down proteins within the bone. The process supplies nutrients for the worms. When these worms sexually mature, eggs are released to start the cycle over.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/5744-worm-species-discovered-dead-whales.html|title=New Worm Species Discovered on Dead Whales|publisher=livescience.com|date=  September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, scientists hypothesized that some species (such as ''Osedax'') might use whale falls as stepping-stones to extend their range across multiple chemosynthetic communities. They estimate that 690,000 carcasses/skeletons of the nine largest whale species are in one of the three stages at any one time. This estimate implies an average spacing of {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr =on}} and as little as {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr =on}} along migration routes. They hypothesize that this distance is short enough to allow [[larvae]] to disperse/migrate from one to another.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

Another polychaetae worm that is known to be abundant at whale falls is Bathykurila guaymasensis.  This worm however does not have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria that breakdown proteins within the whale bones.  Alternatively, Bathykurila guaymasensis is a specialist feeder on the sulfur reducing bacteria Beggiatoa, that grows in abundant mats around a whale fall and hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glover|first1=Adrian G.|last2=Goetze|first2=Erica|last3=Dahlgren|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Smith|first4=Craig R.|title=Morphology, reproductive biology and genetic structure of the whale-fall and hydrothermal vent specialist, ''Bathykurila guaymasensis'' (Annelida: Polynoidae)|journal=Marine Ecology|date=2005|volume=26|issue=3–4|pages=223–234|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0485.2005.00060.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Palaeontology ==
Whale fall fossils from the late [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] (34-23 [[Mya (unit)|MYA]]) in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and from the [[Pliocene]] in Italy include clams that also inhabited non-chemosynthetic environments. Chemosynthetic-only animals do not appear until the [[Miocene]] (23 to 5 MYA) in California and Japan. This may be because the lipid content of early whale bones was too low.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

The discovery of the limpet ''[[Osteopelta]]'' in an Eocene New Zealand turtle bone indicates that these animals evolved before whales, including possibly inhabiting [[Mesozoic]] (251-66 MYA) reptiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaimKobayashi_2008&quot; /&gt; They may have survived in seeps, wood-falls and vents while waiting out the 20 million year gap between the reptiles' extinction and whales' emergence. Another possibility is that these fossils represent a prior, dead-end evolutionary path, and that today's whale fall animals evolved independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;CTS Little&quot; /&gt;

'''Cetacean surfacing behaviour''' is a group of behaviours demonstrated by the [[Cetacea]] infraorder when they come to the water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive, and some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;test_1&quot;&gt;[http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/the-deepest-divers &quot;The Deepest Divers&quot;], Oceanus Magazine, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to respiration, cetaceans have developed and used surface behaviours for many other functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order Cetacea, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. Cetacea is usually split into two suborders, [[Odontoceti]] and [[Mysticeti]], based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, Cetacea can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all [[Odontocetes]] less than 10 m long including [[orca]]&lt;ref name=&quot;test_2&quot;&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/t0725e/t0725e10.pdf], FAO Marine Mammals of the World, Suborder Odontoceti.&lt;/ref&gt;) as many behaviours are correlated with size. Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular [[Whale watching|tourism industry]].

== Travelling surface behaviour ==
=== Breaching and lunging === &lt;!--'Breach' seems to link here, regardless of classification--&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A ''breach'' or a ''lunge'' is a leap out of the water, also known as cresting. The distinction between the two is fairly arbitrary: cetacean researcher [[Hal Whitehead]] defines a breach as any leap in which at least 40% of the animal's body clears the water, and a lunge as a leap with less than 40% clearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hal&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Publications List|author=Whitehead Lab|url=http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/labpub.htm|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitatively, a breach is a genuine jump with an intent to clear the water, whereas a lunge is the result of a fast upward-sloping swim that has caused the whale to clear the surface of the water unintentionally. This latter &quot;lunging&quot; behaviour is often a result of feeding in [[rorqual]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ware2011&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Shallow and deep lunge feeding of humpback whales in fjords of the West Antarctic Peninsula|first1=C.|last1=Ware|first2=A. S.|last2=Friedlaender|first3=D. P.|last3=Nowacek|year=2011|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=27|issue=3|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00427.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right, humpback and sperm whales are the most widely observed jumpers. However other [[baleen whale]]s such as [[Fin whale|fin]], [[Blue whale|blue]], [[Minke whale|minke]], [[Gray whale|gray]] and [[Sei whale|sei]] whales also breach. [[Oceanic dolphin]]s, including the [[orca]], are very common breachers and are in fact capable of lifting themselves completely out of the water very easily, although there is little distinction between this and [[#Porpoising|porpoising]]. Some non-cetacean marine creatures also exhibit breaching behavior, such as several shark species and rays of the genera ''[[Manta ray|Manta]]'' and ''[[Mobula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malbertphoto.com/mobulas1.html|title=The Flying Mobulas of the Sea of Cortez|author= Paul and Michael Albert|date=26 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two techniques are used by cetaceans in order to breach. The first method, most common in sperm and humpback whales, is conducted by swimming vertically upwards from depth, and heading straight out of the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodo&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=This is how whales break through the surface of the water|author=The Dodo|accessdate=2015-05-25|url=https://www.thedodo.com/whales-breach-underwater-gifs-736758901.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other more common method is to travel close to the surface and parallel to it, and then jerk upwards at full speed with as few as 3 tail strokes to perform a breach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CB&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Breaching|publisher=Conscious Breath Adventures|url=http://consciousbreathadventures.com/breaching/|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all breaches the cetacean clears the water with the majority of its body at an acute angle, such as an average of 30° to the horizontal as recorded in sperm whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sperm whales: social evolution in the ocean|author=Hal Whitehead|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=179|ISBN=0-226-89517-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whale then turns to land on its back or side, and less frequently may not turn but &quot;belly flop&quot; instead. In order to achieve 90% clearance, a humpback needs to leave the water at a speed of eight metres per second or {{convert|29|km/h}}. For a {{convert|36|MT|ST}} animal, this results in a [[momentum]] of 288 thousand [[newton second]]s. Despite its energetic cost, breaching is often carried out in series. The longest recorded sustained series was by a humpback near the [[West Indies]] totaling 130 leaps in less than 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/marine/whales/whale_behaviour.html|title=Whale Behaviour|publisher=Animal Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated breaches tire the animal, so that less of the body clears the water each time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead2003&quot;&gt;&gt;{{Citation |title=Sperm Whales: Social Evolution in the Ocean |first=Hal |last=Whitehead |page=181|isbn=0-226-89517-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKXdCli7nI0C&amp;pg=PA181 |year=2003|publisher =University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the reasons for breaching are unknown; however, there is evidence to support a range of hypotheses. Whales are more likely to breach when they are in groups, suggesting that it is a non-acoustic signal to other group members during social behaviour. Scientists have called this theory [[signalling theory|&quot;honest signalling&quot;]]. The immense cloud of bubbles and underwater disturbance following a breach cannot be faked; neighbours then know a breach has taken place. A single breach costs a whale only about 0.075% of its total daily energy intake, but a long series of breaches may add up to a significant energy expenditure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehead2003&quot; /&gt; A breach is therefore a sign that the animal is physically fit enough to afford energy for this acrobatic display, hence it could be used for ascertaining dominance, courting or warning of danger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodo&quot; /&gt; It is also possible that the loud &quot;smack&quot; upon re-entering is useful for stunning or scaring prey, similar to [[#Lobtailing and slapping|lobtailing]]. As breaching is often seen in rough seas it is possible that a breach allows the whale to breathe in air that is not close to the surface and full of spray, or that they use breaching to communicate when the noise of the ocean would mask acoustic signals.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCB&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Why do whales and other sea mammals breach?|author=USCB ScienceLine|url=http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another widely accepted possible reason is to dislodge parasites from the skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCB&quot; /&gt; The behaviour may also be more simply a form of play.&lt;ref name=&quot;USCB&quot; /&gt; Breaching is therefore undoubtedly a very important part of socialising in cetaceans, and is learnt by all cetaceans at an early age from conspecifics.

=== Porpoising ===

''Porpoising'', also known as running,&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=At high speeds dolphins save energy by leaping. |date=1980 |first1=D. |last1=Au |first2=D. |last2=Weihs |journal=Nature |volume=284 |pages=548–550 |doi=10.1038/284548a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a high speed surface behaviour of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, as well as other marine species such as [[penguins]]&lt;ref name=&quot;OH5&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The porpoising of penguins an energy-conserving behaviour for respiratory ventilation? |first1=C.

At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6&amp;nbsp;m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowholes]] along with up to one third of their body at any one time.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH6&quot; /&gt; Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain [[metabolism]] and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH6&quot; /&gt; These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities.

Although porpoising is a useful product of rapid swimming, a lot of variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the [[spinner dolphin]] leads to lots of splashing and is more common at slower speeds&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore more likely to be a form of play or communication within or between pods.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH4&quot; /&gt; Another reason might be to remove [[barnacles]] or small sharks such as [[remora]]s that, when attached, increase drag during swimming.&lt;ref name=&quot;test_10&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Mechanics of remora removal by dolphin spinning |year=2007 |journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=23 |pages=707–714 |first1=D. |last1=Weihs |first2=F.

The term ''wave-riding'' is most commonly used to describe the surface activity of cetaceans that approach boats and jump repeatedly in the waves produced by the boats. This includes ''bow-riding'', where cetaceans are in the pressure wave in front of the boat, and ''wake-riding'', where they are off the stern in the wake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2010&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Seasonal and Diurnal Patterns of Behavior Exhibited by Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'') in the Mississippi Sound|journal=Ethology|year=2010|first1=L.

However, at higher speeds dolphins and porpoises will seek out the pressure wave and its maximum energy zone in order to ride the wave by holding their flukes in a fixed plane, with only minor adjustments for repositioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams1992&quot; /&gt; Wave-riding reduces the energetic cost of swimming to the dolphin, even when compared to slower swimming speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams1992&quot; /&gt; For example, [[heart rate]], [[metabolic rate]] and transport cost was reduced by up to 70% during wave-riding compared to swimming at speeds 1&amp;nbsp;m/s slower in [[bottlenose dolphin]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams1992&quot; /&gt; Wave-riding behaviour can be performed by dolphins from minutes up to several hours,&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams1992&quot; /&gt; and therefore is a useful energy-saving mechanism for swimming at higher speeds.

Wave-riding is most common in small [[Odontocete]]s. It has also been observed in larger cetaceans such as [[false killer whale]]s and [[orca]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahlheim1980&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Killer whales observed bowriding|first1=M. E.|last1=Dahlheim|journal=The Murrelet|page=78|jstor=3535038}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most larger Odontocetes do not seek out any form of interaction with boats. Bow-riding is the most common form of interactive behaviour with boats across a variety of smaller Odontocete species, such as dolphins in the genera ''[[Stenella]]'' and ''[[Delphinus (genus)|Delphinus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritter2003&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Interactions of cetaceans with whale watching boats–implications for the management of whale watching tourism|year=2003|first1=F.|last1=Ritter|journal=MEER eV, Berlin, Germany|url=http://www.m-e-e-r.org/uploads/media/Executive_Summary_Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of interaction can often depend on the behavioural state of the group as well as species. For example, spotted dolphins are more likely to interact when travelling or milling but less likely when they are socialising or surface feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritter2003&quot; /&gt; Interactive behaviour may also depend on group composition, as both orca and bottlenose dolphins have been recorded to interact mostly when a calf was in the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritter2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkins2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Interactive behaviours of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) during encounters with vessels|first1=E.|last1=Hawkins|first2=D.

Another result of cetaceans traveling in pods is an increase in competition for the optimal wave energy and so maximum energy saving position. It has therefore been suggested that position of individuals reflect the dominance [[hierarchy]] of the pod and therefore could be used to ascertain dominance, such as a dominant male orca remaining nearest the water's surface at the bow of the boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahlheim1980&quot; /&gt; Several [[rorqual]]s, such as [[minke whale|minke]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbase.com/maceg/image/3653655&lt;/ref&gt; [[sei whale|sei]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50dEXQSjdSI&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bryde's whale|bryde's]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expeditions.com/daily-expedition-reports/179002/|title=Boná Island and Panama Canal, Panama|date=January 14, 2016|work=Expeditions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[humpback whale|humpback]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2601833/Having-whale-time-Photographer-captures-rare-moment-mother-humpback-whale-calf-ride-wave.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/odyssey/odyssey/20021230_log_transcript.html|title=Bowriding Humpback Whales – Log Transcript|date=December 30, 2002|work=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gray whale|gray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2016/02/03/2-gray-whales-caught-some-waves-near-mission-beach/|title=2 gray whales catch waves near Mission Beach|date=February 3, 2016|work=FOX5 San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to display actions in similar manners.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

When ''spyhopping'', the whale rises and holds a vertical position partially out of the water, often exposing its entire [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] and head. It is visually akin to a human [[treading water]]. Spyhopping is controlled and slow, and can last for minutes at a time if the whale is sufficiently inquisitive about whatever it is viewing. Generally, the whale does not appear to swim by fluke propulsion to maintain its &quot;elevated&quot; position while spyhopping, instead relying on exceptional buoyancy control and positioning with pectoral fins. Typically the whale's eyes will be slightly above or below the surface of the water, enabling it to see whatever is nearby on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com.au/education/media/spyhopping/?ar_a=1|publisher=National Geographic|title=Gray Whale Spyhop|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[great white shark]] and [[oceanic whitetip shark]] have also been known to spyhop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zimmerman&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Do Sharks &quot;Spyhop&quot;|author=Tim Zimmerman|url=http://timzimmermann.com/2013/06/13/do-sharks-spyhop/|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spyhopping often occurs during a &quot;mugging&quot; situation, where the focus of a whale's attention is on a boat, such as whale-watching tours, which they sometimes approach and interact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Behavioral response of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) to vessel traffic|year=2003|journal=Marine Environmental Research|first1=S.

Often when cetaceans breach, their eyes do not clear the water, which suggests it might not be used for looking but instead for hearing. For example, [[gray whale]]s will often spy-hop in order to hear better when they are near the line where waves begin to break in the ocean as this marks out their migration route.&lt;ref name=&quot;NG&quot; /&gt; It can therefore be said that spy-hopping behaviour is used for many different reasons across a wide range of species.

=== Lobtailing and slapping ===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

''Lobtailing'' is the act of a whale or dolphin lifting its [[fluke (tail)|fluke]] out of the water and then bringing them down onto the surface of the water hard and fast in order to make a loud slap. Large whales tend to lobtail by positioning themselves vertically downwards into the water and then slapping the surface by bending the tail stock. Dolphins, however, tend to remain horizontal, either on their belly or their back, and make the slap via a jerky whole body movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWH&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Lobtailing Marine Mammals|author=What When How|url=http://what-when-how.com/marine-mammals/lobtailing-marine-mammals/|accessdate=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All species are likely to slap several times in a single session. Like breaching, lobtailing is common amongst active cetacean species such as sperm, humpback, right and [[gray whale|grey whale]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWH&quot; /&gt; It is less common, but still occasionally occurs, amongst the other large whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWH&quot; /&gt; [[Porpoise]]s and [[river dolphin]]s rarely lobtail, but it is a very common phenomenon amongst [[oceanic dolphin]]s. Lobtailing is more common within species that have a complex social order than those where animals are more likely to be solitary.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWH&quot; /&gt; Lobtaling often occurs in conjunction with other aerial behaviour such as breaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWH&quot; /&gt; Species with large [[flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] may also slap them against the water for a similar effect, known as [[#pectoral slapping|pectoral slapping]].

The sound of a lobtail can be heard underwater several hundred metres from the site of a slap. This has led to speculation amongst scientists that lobtailing is, like breaching, a form of non-vocal communication. However, studies of [[bowhead whale]]s have shown that the noise of a lobtail travels much less well than that of a vocal call or a breach. Thus the lobtail is probably important visually as well as acoustically, and may be a sign of aggression. Some suggest that lobtailing in [[humpback whale]]s is a means of foraging. The hypothesis is that the loud noise causes fish to become frightened, thus tightening their [[school (biology)|school]] together, making it easier for the humpback to feed on them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinrich1992&quot;&gt;&gt;{{Citation|title=Evidence for acquisition of a novel feeding behaviour: lobtail feeding in humpback whales, ''Megaptera novaeangliae''|first1=Mason T. |last1=Weinrich |first2=Mark R.|last2=Schilling |first3=Cynthia R. |last3=Belt |journal=Animal Behaviour

The spread of lobtail feeding amongst humpback whales indicates its success as a novel foraging method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinrich1992&quot;/&gt;

=== Peduncle throw ===
A ''[[caudal peduncle|peduncle]] throw'', also known as ''peduncling'', is a surfacing behaviour unique to humpback whales. During this the humpback converts its forward momentum into a crack-the-whip rotation, pivoting with its pectorals as it drives its head downward and thrusts its entire fluke and peduncle (the muscular rear portion of the torso) out of the water and sideways, before crashing into the water with terrific force. Peduncling takes place among the focal animals (female, escort, challenging male) in a competitive group, apparently as an aggressive gesture. Possibilities include escorts fending off a particular challenging male, females who seem agitated with an escort, or an individual not comfortable with a watching boat's presence. Occasionally, one whale performs a series of dozens of peduncle throws, directed at the same target each time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaniklides&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stavros_Kaniklides/publication/262894383_Dr._PhD_Stavros_Kaniklides_-Effects_of_Volcanic_Tsunamis_on_Marine_Mammals_Research_Paper/links/0f3175391b66da1300000000.pdf|title=The effects of volcanic tsunamis on marine mammals|author=Dr Stavros Kaniklides|publisher=ResearchGate|accessdate=2015-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pectoral slapping'', informally known as pec-slapping, is when a cetacean turns on its side, exposes one or both [[pectoral fins]] into the air, and then slaps them against the surface of the water. It is a form of non-vocal communication commonly observed in a variety of whale and dolphin species as well as seals. The motion is slow and controlled, and the behaviour can occur repeatedly by one individual over a few minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH1&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Pec-slapping varies between groups of different social structure, such as not occurring in lone males but being common in mother calf pairs and also when they are accompanied by an escort.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH1&quot; /&gt; The reasons for pec-slapping therefore can vary depending on age and sex of individual humpback whales. During the breeding season adult males pec-slap before they disassociate with a group of males that are vying for a female, whereas adult females pec-slap to attract potential mates and indicate that she is sexually receptive.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH2&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Exposure of the pectoral fin and consequent slapping has also been infrequently observed in blue whales, where it is most often a by-product of lunge feeding followed by rolling on to its side.

[[Whale watching]] is carried out on every continent, with an estimated 13 million people participating in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;OH7&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits: a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA. |first1=S. |last1=O'Connor |first2=R. |last2=Campbell |first3=H. |last3=Cortez |first4=T. |last4=Knowles |journal=Economists at Large |year=2009 |url=http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, when combined with the sustained increase in boat vessel traffic, has likely affected the surface activity of cetaceans. When boats and other whale watching vessels approach, most cetaceans will either avoid or seek interactions.

For example, studies on [[killer whale]]s in North America have shown that the focal animals increased their tail-slapping behaviour when approached by boats within 100 m, and that 70% of surface active behaviours (SABs) in these orca were seen when a boat was within 225 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noren2009&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Close approaches by vessels elicit surface active behaviors by southern resident killer whales.|year=2009|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=8|issue=3|pages=179–192|doi=10.3354/esr00205|first1=D.

There is a lack of understanding about the long-term effects of whale-watching on the behaviour of cetaceans, but it is theorised that it may cause avoidance of popular sites,&lt;ref name=&quot;Corkeron1995&quot; /&gt; or a decrease in the energy budget for individuals involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stamation2010&quot; /&gt;

'''The Húsavík Whale Museum''' is a non-profit organization established in 1997. The Húsavík Whale Museum is situated in [[Húsavík]], a small town in north east [[Iceland]], on the shores of [[Skjálfandi|Skjálfandi Bay]], just below the [[Arctic Circle]] at 66° N.
It began as a small exhibit on whales in the town’s hotel in summer 1997. Shortly after that, the exhibition was moved into the newly renovated part of the baiting shed at the harbor and the shareholding business “Húsavík Whale Centre ehf” was established. Due to the growing popularity, it was obvious that a larger and more suitable building was needed after only 3 years. In 2000, the town’s old slaughterhouse (built in 1931 and abandoned in the 1980s) was purchased, remodeled, and officially opened in June 2002. 
In 2004, the shareholding business turned into a non-profit organization and was renamed “The Húsavík Whale Museum.” By 2005, a comprehensive exhibition on the ecology of [[whales]] was added. 

==Museum==
The museum’s purpose is to educate the public about whales, with emphasis on the species occurring in the North Atlantic. The exhibition provides informative and attractive displays that have the capacity to raise awareness about [[cetaceans]] and their environment. The scientific component includes an introduction to the museum’s research, which has been expanding since 2001 and now includes international collaborations and publications. The museum was acknowledged as an educational facility by the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Iceland)|Icelandic Ministry of Education]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Museum | url=http://www.whalemuseum.is/museum/ |publisher= The Húsavík Whale Museum | accessdate = 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition area===
[[Image:whalingroom.jpg|left|thumb|Interior of the Whale Museum]]

The Whale Museum offers 1.600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of exhibition area displayed on two stories. Special attention is given to the manner in which information is presented. Exhibits often reveal the work and creative input of many staff members throughout the museum’s history. Illustrations and interactive exhibits accompany the texts to captivate the imagination of visitors and encourage further reading. The lower floor hosts a section on marine ecosystems, introducing visitors to the habitat and ecology of whales. Additional exhibits describe the cetacean species in the North Atlantic and their natural history, strandings, whale watching and past/present Icelandic [[whaling]]. Further information can be found on dolphins with emphasis on the most common species in Icelandic waters. Special attention is given to orcas, including the most famous Icelandic orca, [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]]. Two documentaries about whaling and the conflict between whaling and whale watching are offered to give visitors an introduction to the issue. 
The museum’s upper floor contains the “whale gallery” with authentic skeletons of 9 species. The first skeleton assembled was a Sowerby’s beaked whale ([[Mesoplodon bidens]]) in 1998, followed by the minke whale ([[Balaenoptera acutorostrata]]) and the sperm whale ([[Physeter macrocephalus]]). Other species added were the humpback whale ([[Megaptera novaeangliae]]), orca ([[Orcinus orca]]), Cuvier’s beaked whale ([[Ziphius cavirostris]]), northern bottlenose whale ([[Hyperoodon ampullatus]]), and long-finned pilot whale ([[Globicephala melas]]). In 2004, the remarkable skeleton of a narwhal ([[Monodon monoceros]]) was donated to the museum from [[Greenland]].

===Volunteer program===
[[Image:whaleskeleton2.jpg|right|thumb|Whale skeleton]]
From the start, the museum has hosted an international volunteer program, which at the time was rather uncommon in Iceland. Participants in the volunteer program have mostly been students of biology or related topics. The volunteers are invaluable to daily operation of the museum and ensure that it can sustain the extended hours of operation during the summer season. The volunteers provide translations of texts, work towards the improvement of exhibits, and take part in the museum’s research program. Volunteers gain the opportunity to learn more about the whales and experience them in their natural environment. They quickly become capable of providing guests with a professional guiding through the museum and can often educate visitors in a number of languages. The Volunteers participate in the museum’s whale research that has been performed for several years. The volunteers take one trip per day in the whale boats, collecting the data needed for the research program. The museum’s database is constantly updated and used by researchers for further studies.

==Whale research==
Research at the Whale Museum began in 1998, but the data collected had been given to another institution. Several years later, the museum decided to establish its own database. In agreement with a local whale watching company called North Sailing, the museum staff has the opportunity to collect data in the field each summer. The museum collaborates with both universities and researchers. To date, the research program has focused mainly on [[photo identification]], but also on habitat studies and cetacean respiration patterns.

The '''52-hertz whale''' is an individual [[whale]] of unidentified species, which calls at the very unusual frequency of 52&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]. This pitch is a much higher frequency than that of the other whale species with migration patterns most closely resembling this whale's&lt;ref name=&quot;newsci&quot;/&gt; – the [[blue whale]] (10–39&amp;nbsp;Hz)&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; or [[fin whale]] (20&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name=&quot;newsci&quot;/&gt; It has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s and appears to be the only individual emitting a [[Whale vocalization|whale call]] at this frequency. It has been described as the &quot;world's loneliest whale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/maybe-worlds-loneliest-whale-isnt-so-isolated-after-all-180955005/?no-ist |title=Maybe the World's Loneliest Whale Isn't So Isolated, After All &amp;#124; Smart News &amp;#124; Smithsonian |doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2004.08.006 |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{listen |filename=Ak52 10x.ogg |title=The 52-hertz whale|description=The signal was recorded in the northeast Pacific. It has been sped up ten times, raising the pitch to 520 Hz.}}
The sonic signature is that of a whale, albeit at a unique frequency. At 52 hertz, it is just higher than the lowest note on a [[tuba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; The call patterns resemble neither [[Blue whale|blue]] nor [[fin whale]]s, being much higher in frequency, shorter, and more frequent.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc&quot; /&gt; Blue whales usually vocalize at 10–39&amp;nbsp;Hz,&lt;ref name=Cornell/&gt; fin whales at 20&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsci&quot; /&gt; The 52-hertz calls of this whale are highly variable in their pattern of repetition, duration, and sequence, although they are easily identifiable due to their frequency and characteristic clustering.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoitech&quot; /&gt; The calls have deepened slightly to around 49 hertz since 1992, suggesting the whale has grown or matured.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc&quot; /&gt;

The track of the 52-hertz whale is unrelated to the presence or movement of other whale species.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; Its movements have been somewhat similar to that of blue whales, but its timing has been more like that of fin whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoitech&quot; /&gt; It is detected in the [[Pacific Ocean]] every year beginning in August–December, and moves out of range of the [[hydrophone]]s in January–February. It travels as far north as the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Kodiak Islands]], and as far south as the California coast, swimming between 30 and 70&amp;nbsp;km each day. Its recorded distance traveled per season has ranged from a low of 708&amp;nbsp;km to a high of 11,062&amp;nbsp;km in 2002–03.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceanus&quot; /&gt;

Scientists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] have been unable to identify the species of the whale. They speculate that it could be [[Congenital disorder|malformed]], or possibly a blue whale/fin whale [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; The research team has been contacted by deaf people who believe the whale may be deaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;

Whatever biological cause underlies its unusually high frequency voice does not seem to be detrimental to its survival. The fact that the whale has survived and apparently matured indicates it is probably healthy. Still, its unique call is the only one of its kind detected anywhere and there is only one such source per season.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceanus&quot; /&gt; Because of this, the animal has been called the loneliest whale in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;disc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willingham&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot; /&gt;

== History ==
The 52-hertz whale was discovered by a team from the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. Its call was first detected in 1989, then again in 1990 and 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceanus&quot; /&gt; In 1992, following the end of the [[Cold War]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] partially declassified the recordings and technical specifications of its [[SOSUS]] anti-submarine hydrophone arrays, and made SOSUS available for oceanographic research.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whoitech&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--please indicate why the information in the previous sentence is relevant to the article--&gt; As of 2014, the whale had been detected every year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Kieran|title=The loneliest whale in the world?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/01/26/the-loneliest-whale-in-the-world/|accessdate=23 February 2017|work=Washington Post|date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by scientists at Woods Hole has been supported by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], and the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], in addition to the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;oceanus&quot; /&gt;

== Documentary ==
A feature-length documentary entitled ''52: The Search for the Loneliest Whale'' is in production, shot by Joshua Zeman, the director of ''[[Cropsey (film)|Cropsey]]'', and produced by [[Adrian Grenier]]. Funded through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, the film is due for release sometime in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://52thesearch.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Short film ==
''The Loneliest'', a short [[mockumentary]] film about two women searching for the loneliest whale, was made in April 2014 by Lilian Mehrel, with the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York Times|url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/17/filmmakers-set-sights-on-52-the-worlds-loneliest-whale/?smid=fb-share}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Loneliest|url=http://www.theloneliestfilm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Montreal-based saxophone player and composer [[Colin Stetson]]'s 2013 album ''[[New History Warfare Vol. 3: To See More Light]]'' included a song entitled &quot;Part of Me Apart From You&quot;. Though not explicitly written about the 52-hertz whale, when first performing the song live, he remarked on at least several occasions that the story of the &quot;loneliest whale&quot; resonated deeply with his composition. &quot;This whale is alone in a large body of water, swimming, singing its song, calling for a likeness it will never find,&quot; he said by way of introducing the song at a performance at Toronto's Great Hall on 19 May 2013. &quot;When I play this song, I can't help but think about this whale, who right at this very minute is singing alone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/colin_stetson-great_hall_toronto_on_may_19|title=Colin Stetson|work=exclaim.ca|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korean hip-hop group [[BTS (band)|BTS]]'s 2015 album ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'''s fourth track, &quot;Whalien 52&quot;, explicitly uses the 52-hertz whale as a metaphor for the alienation from others often felt by adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=BTS Succeeds With Mixed Styles, Emotions on 'Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/6784945/bts-most-beautiful-moment-in-life-pt-2-run-review|website=Billboard|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whale watching]] is a popular pastime{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in [[Sydney]] in the winter and spring. There are a number of different migration and whale seasons.

==Humpback migration==
The [[humpback whale]] migration passing Sydney takes place between April and December each year. The season is split into two distinct sections depending on the direction of travel of the majority of whales at that time.

The migrating population is named the Group 5 Southern Hemisphere humpback whale population or the Australian East coast humpbacks. As distinct from other humpback migration populations that travel along the West Australian and South African coasts.
 
The distance from the coast of the whales is believed to be based on the movements of the ocean currents, primarily the [[East Australian Current]]. The East Australian Current is a strong southerly current that the humpback whales make use of during their southern migration. On the Northern migration the Humpback whales will often use the Inshore Northern current, which is a north flowing counter current to the EAC. The main purpose of the annual humpback migration is to breed.

For either migration the best shore locations to watch the whales are on high points along the coast, cliffs and headlands.

From South to North the best locations are:

*Cape Solander, [[Kurnell]], [[Botany Bay National Park]]&lt;ref name=NPWSsolander&gt;{{cite web| title=Cape Solander|url=http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Kamay-Botany-Bay-National-Park/Cape-Solander/lookout| publisher=[[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)]]| accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Cape Banks, La Perouse
*[[Magic Point]], Maroubra
*[[Ben Buckler]], Bondi
*South Head Signal Station, South Head
*North head Lookout, North Head National Park
*Long Reef point

Spotting whales from elsewhere including directly off the beaches is quite possible, just less common.

Commercial whale watching tours run daily through the humpback seasons and can be boarded at [[Darling Harbour]], [[Circular Quay]] and other wharfs around Sydney Harbour.

=== Northern migration ===
From April to mid August the Humpbacks are heading north to give birth and mate in the waters of the Coral Sea. At this time of year they tend to swim constantly north at 4-5 knots (5–9&amp;nbsp;km/h) and will have regular surface intervals.

At this time the whales are utilizing the Inshore Northern current to assist them on the way north. This current is usually found only within {{convert|3|nmi|km}} of the coast, so most of the migrating population will pass within this distance. This is the easiest time for shore based spotters to see the full population of humpback whales passing by the Sydney coast as they head north.

Often on the Northern migration, especially when the currents are strong close to shore, a Humpback pod may enter the harbour for a short time. Normally they will leave again within a few hours and will rarely venture far from the harbour entrance.

====Typical behavior====
{{main|Whale surfacing behaviour}}
:* [[Whale surfacing behaviour#Breaching, lunging, and porpoising|Breaching]]
:* [[Whale surfacing behaviour#Lobtailing and slapping|Tail slapping]]
:* Lunging

=== Southern migration ===

From mid August to mid December the Humpbacks are heading south to return to the Antarctic feeding ground for the southern hemisphere summer. While they will tend southwards they may swim in any direction for hours at a time, with less consistent surface intervals.

At this time they generally swim slower than on the northern migration and use the East Australian Current to move them south. The EAC tends to begin around the {{convert|3|nmi|km|adj=on}} line and may peak in strength up to 10-20 nautical miles from the coast. This means the Southern Humpback migration can sometimes be very difficult to spot from on shore.

However, during Early October to Mid December the mothers and newborn calves pass south, they tend to swim very close to the shoreline. Often they will stop in protected areas to close to beaches to rest and feed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/whale-watch/whale-takes-calf-sightseeing-in-harbour/2007/11/12/1194766559703.html Whale takes calf sightseeing in harbour]&quot; Sydney Morning Herald, 12 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical behavior====
:*  Breaching
:* Tail slapping
:* [[Whale surfacing behaviour#Spyhopping|Spyhops]]
:* Mugging (approaching boats to inspect them)
:* Feeding (mothers and calves)

== Southern right season ==

The [[southern right whale]] does not migrate in the same pattern as the humpback whales, however during the winter months the southern rights will move along the coastline seeking places to mate and shelter with their newborn calves.

They will enter and remain in bays and harbors for days at a time and then move slowly north or south. While they are not as common as the humpback whales, they will tend to make a greater impact since they are far more visible and do not move away as quickly. In the past they have ventured as far as the Harbour Bridge in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-08-18/whales-explore-inner-sydney-harbour/2027834 ABC News, Aug 18 2004, Whales explore inner Sydney Harbour]&lt;/ref&gt; and into Botany Bay as well as resting meters from the shore line of popular surf beaches.

== Other whales ==

[[Minke whale]]s, [[Bryde's whale]]s, [[false killer whale]]s, [[killer whale]]s and [[pilot whale]]s will pass the coast at various times, as well as very rarely blue, fin and [[sei whale]]s. [[Sperm whale]]s are present off the coast of Sydney but tend to stay near the edge of the continental shelf over {{convert|20|nmi|km}} to sea, so are not often seen close to shore.

== Dolphins ==

Large and small pods of [[common dolphin]] and [[bottlenose dolphins]] are quite common on the Sydney coastline, they are present throughout the year and can be easily seen from the coast.

==Volunteer stations==

During the humpback migration there are two whale research and observation stations staffed by Volunteers as part of the [[Macquarie University]] &amp; [https://www.whalewatchingsydney.com.au/about-whales/research Bass &amp; Flinders Cruises] Research partnership into whale watching sustainability. These volunteers have a number of tasks that take precedence, but are generally happy to assist the public with information and spotting whale pods.

#Cape Solander
#:From Late May to Early of August, for the northern migration annual whale survey.
#North Head
#:From Late May to End of August, as research spotters for vessel whale interactions.

'''Whale watching''' is the practice of observing [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s ([[cetacean]]s) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. [[birdwatching]]), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot;&gt;Hoyt, E. 2009. Whale watching. In Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, 2nd Edition (Perrin, W.F., B. Würsig and J.G.M. Thewissen, eds.) Academic Press, San Diego, CA., pp1219-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; A study prepared for [[International Fund for Animal Welfare|IFAW]] in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S., Campbell, R., Cortez, H., &amp; Knowles, T., 2009, Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits, a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA, prepared by Economists at Large. http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide&lt;/ref&gt; The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the [[whaling]] industry about the best use of whales as a [[natural resource]].

== History ==
Organized whale watching dates back to 1950 when the [[Cabrillo National Monument]] in [[San Diego]] was declared a public venue for observing [[Gray Whale]]s and the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt; In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt; The industry spread throughout the western coast of the [[United States]] over the following decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt;

In 1971 the Montreal Zoological Society commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the [[St. Lawrence River]] to view [[Fin Whale|Fin]] and [[Beluga Whale]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt;

In 1984, [[Erich Hoyt]] published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, ''The Whale Watcher's Handbook'' which [[Mark Carwardine]] called his number one &quot;natural classic&quot; book in ''BBC Wildlife'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine, M. 1995. ''Natural Classic'', BBC Wildlife, July, p79.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985 more visitors watched whales from [[New England]] than California. The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense population of [[Humpback Whale]]s, whose acrobatic behavior such as breaching (jumping out of the water) and tail-slapping thrilled observers, and the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot;&gt;Hoyt, E. 2001. Whale Watching  2001: Worldwide Tourism Numbers, Expenditures, and Expanding Socioeconomic Benefits. International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth Port, MA, USA, pp. 1-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale watching tourism has grown substantially since the mid-1980s. The first worldwide survey of whale watching was conducted by [[Erich Hoyt]] for the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] (WDCS) in 1992. It was updated in 1995 and submitted by the UK government to the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) meetings as a demonstration of the value of living whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt; In 1999, the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare|IFAW]] commissioned [[Erich Hoyt]] to expand the detail and coverage of the survey and this was published in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt; In 2009 the survey was completed by a team of economists and this report estimated that in 2008, 13 million people went whale watching, up from 9 million ten years earlier.  Commercial whale watching operations were found in 119 countries.  Direct revenue of whale watching trips was estimated at US$872.7 million and indirect revenue of $2,113.1 million was spent by whale watchers in tourism-related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide|title=Whale Watching Worldwide|work=IFAW – International Fund for Animal Welfare|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale watching is of particular importance to developing countries. Coastal communities have started to profit directly from the whales' presence, significantly adding to popular support for the protection of these animals from commercial whaling and other threats such as bycatch and ship strikes using the tool of [[marine protected areas]] and sanctuaries. In 2007, the Humane Society International sponsored a series of workshops to introduce whale watching to coastal Peru and commissioned [[Erich Hoyt]] to write a blueprint for high quality, sustainable whale watching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2012&quot;&gt;Hoyt, E. 2012. Whale Watching Blueprint – I. Setting up a marine ecotourism operation. Nature Editions, North Berwick, Scotland [{{ISBN|978-1-908732-00-2}} (eBook)]&lt;/ref&gt; This manual, later translated into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch, with co-sponsorship from WDCS, IFAW and Global Ocean was updated in English in 2012 in ebook form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2012&quot; /&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:Whale-watching-australia.jpg|thumb|Whale watching operator giving a talk about whales and their conservation]]
The rapid growth of the number of whale watching trips and the size of vessel used to watch whales may affect whale behavior, migratory patterns and breeding cycles. There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.

Environmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the &quot;quick-buck&quot; mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations). Common rules include:

*Minimize speed/&quot;No wake&quot; speed
*Avoid sudden turns
*Minimize noise
*Do not pursue, encircle or come in between whales
*Approach animals from angles where they will not be taken by surprise
*Consider cumulative impact – minimize number of boats at any one time/per day
*Do not coerce dolphins into bow-riding.
*Do not allow swimming with dolphins. (This last rule is more contentious and is often disregarded in, for example, the [[Caribbean]].) In New Zealand, the rules adopted under the [[Marine Mammals Protection Act]] specifically allow swimming with dolphins and seals but not with juvenile dolphins or a pod of dolphins that includes juvenile dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0322/latest/DLM168840.html Marine Mammals Protection Regulations 1992 §&amp;nbsp;20](b)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avistamiento.JPG|thumb|Typical bad whale watching in [[El Vizcaíno]], with people trying to enter in contact with the animal]]
In Uruguay, where whales can be watched from the beach, legislators have designated the country's territorial waters as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2013/12/16/uruguay-becomes-a-sanctuary-for-whales-and-dolphins/|title=Uruguay Becomes a &quot;Sanctuary for Whales and Dolphins&quot; · Global Voices|date=2013-12-16|website=Global Voices|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to be less than 300 metres from a whale.

== Locations ==

Whale watching tours are available in various locations and climates. By area, they are:

=== South Africa ===
[[File:Brydes whale.jpg|thumb|[[Brydes whale]] in [[False Bay]], South Africa]]
In [[South Africa]], the town of [[Hermanus]] is one of the world centers for whale watching. Between May and December [[southern right whales]] come so close to the Cape shoreline that visitors can watch whales from their hotels. The town employs a &quot;whale crier&quot; (cf [[town crier]]) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.

You can watch the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale watching tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from June till Mid December.  [[Port Elizabeth]] runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde's whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of [[Algoa Bay]]), and southern right whales from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction in a number of other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to [[conservation biology|conservation]] and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer [[marine conservation]] organisations. [[Plettenberg Bay]] is visited by southern right whales in the winter months and [[humpback whale]]s in the summer months. Bryde's whales are resident throughout the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt; The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon's Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include southern right whales, humpback whales and Bryde's whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Haveside dolphins. The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon's Town.

=== Southwest Atlantic ===
[[File:Baleia de Bryde.jpg|thumb| [[Brydes whale]] breaching in [[Baia de Castelhanos]], north of [[Sao Paulo]], Brasil]]
In [[Brazil]], humpbacks are observed off [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] in [[Bahia State]] and at the National Marine Park of [[Abrolhos Marine National Park|Abrolhos]] during their breeding season in austral winter and spring. Likewise, southern right whales are observed from shore in [[Santa Catarina State]] during the same season. Mother/calf pairs can come as close to shore as 30 meters (about 100 feet). Income from whale watching bolsters coastal communities and has made the township of [[Imbituba]], the Brazilian &quot;whale capital&quot;.

In [[Argentina]], [[Península Valdés]] in [[Patagonia]] hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population of southern right whales, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the [[Whale Conservation Institute]] and [[Ocean Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanalliance.org Ocean Alliance website&lt;/ref&gt; The region contains six natural reserves, and is considered to be one of the premier whale watching destinations in the world, particularly around the town of [[Puerto Pirámides]] and the city of [[Puerto Madryn]], as the whales come within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the main beach and play a major part in the large [[ecotourism]] industry in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt;

In [[Uruguay]], southern right whales are observable from the beach in two coastal departments – [[Maldonado Department|Maldonado]] and [[Rocha Department|Rocha]] from June to November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guruguay.com/whale-watching/|title=5 of the best places to whale-watch in Uruguay|date=2015-06-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The points where most sightings in Maldonado are made are [[Punta Colorada]], [[Punta Negra, Uruguay|Punta Negra]], Playa Mansa and Punta Salinas in [[Punta del Este]], and in Rocha off [[La Paloma, Rocha|La Paloma]] and [[La Pedrera, Rocha|La Pedrera]] beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.descubriendouruguay.com/auc.aspx?176450,1276,0,,0|title=Descubriendo Uruguay – Montevideo Portal|website=www.descubriendouruguay.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Pacific ===
[[File:Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) (16358018502).jpg|thumb|Southern right whale, offshore from Cheynes, [[Western Australia]] ]]
In [[Western Australia]], whales are watched near [[Cape Naturaliste]] in the south-east [[Indian Ocean]] and at [[Cape Leeuwin]] where the Indian and [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] Oceans meet.

In the [[Southern Ocean]] there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. Albany on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] a popular site is Logan's Beach at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], as well as in the waters off [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140914141221/http://www.abc.net.au/oceans/whale/spot.htm Whale Dreams: Spotting whales in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tasmania]] whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|River Derwent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismtasmania.com.au/media/facts/whales Tourism Tasmania :: Whales &amp; Dolphins]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Australia]] whales are watched in the [[Great Australian Bight]] Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching#where |title=Where to see whales and dolphins in the wild |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=2009-01-12 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127051045/http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching |archivedate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Australia, whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into [[Sydney Harbour]].

New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonbayhotels.net.au/nelson-bay-activities/interesting-information-whale-watching-port-stephens/|title=Travelicious Australia   –  Nelson Bay Hotels|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutwhales.com.au|title=2015 NSW whale watching season – Wild About Whales – NSW National Parks|author=#|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Colombia]], the towns of [[Bahía Solano]] and [[Nuquí]] are visited by a large number of Humpback whales from late July to the beginning of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/vacations-holidays-where-to-go/pacific-coast-travel-guide|title=The Pacific|work=Colombia Travel|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Costa Rica, [[Marino Ballena National Park]] has two seasons when whales visit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In [[Panama]], the [[Pearl Islands]] archipelago receive an estimated 300 humpbacks whale from late June to late November. These had become now the main attraction for whale watching tours starting in [[Panama City]]. In the [[Gulf of Chiriqui]], the World Heritage Site of [[Coiba Island]] National Park and the islands near the town of Boca Chica are offering opportunities for whale watching. Isla Iguana near [[Pedasí township, Los Santos|Pedasi]] is now a popular destination for whale watchers. Several foundations train local community members to perform as guide and captains for whale watching tours.

In [[Ecuador]], from June to September, there are many sites from which large groups of humpback whales can be seen, including Isla de la Plata (AKA Little Galapagos) and [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], at the tip of the [[Santa Elena Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt;

=== Northeast Atlantic ===
Tidal straits, inlets, lagoons, and varying water temperatures provide diverse habitats for multiple cetacean species. Substantial numbers live off the coasts of [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Iceland]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[France]]. Commercial car ferries crossing the [[Bay of Biscay]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] to [[Spain]] and [[France]] often pass by enormous [[blue whales]] and much smaller [[harbor porpoise]]. Land-based tours can often view these animals.

Off the south coast of Ireland, [[humpback whale]]s and [[fin whale]]s are regularly seen on organized whale watching trips between July and February. Species seen all year include [[minke whale]]s, [[common dolphin]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[Orca]]s and [[harbour porpoise]]s. There is also a resident group of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in the [[Shannon Estuary]] which attracts tourists all year round.

In [[northern Norway]] ([[Nordland]] and [[Troms]]) [[orca]]s are visible in the [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]], [[Tysfjorden]], [[Ofotfjorden]] and [[Andfjorden]] as the [[herring]] gathers in the [[fjord]]s to stay over the winter and off the [[Lofoten islands]] during the summer. At [[Andenes]] on [[Andøya]] in [[Vesterålen]] and around [[Krøttøya]] in [[Troms]], [[sperm whale]]s can be observed year round, summer whale watching trips occur from May till September, winter trips with [[killer whales]] and [[humpback whales]] are offered from October till April. [[Tromsø]] also offers whale watching for sperm whales and other whales. The continental shelf [[Eggakanten]] and deep water where the [[sperm whale]]s congregate, is very close to shore, beginning only {{convert|7000|m|ft|sp=us}} from the [[Andenes]] harbour.

In [[Portugal]]  whale watching is available in the [[Algarve]]. [[Lagos]] and [[Portimão]] are the most important whale watching places. The species observed in this area are: [[bottlenose dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[striped dolphin]], [[pilot whale]], [[fin whale]] and [[orca]].

In the middle of the Northeast Atlantic, around the [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]] archipelagos, whale watching is on the increase and popular due to more protection and education. One of the most common whales in these regions is the sperm whale, especially groups of calving females.

In [[Spain]] whale watching is available along the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[Canary Islands]], and in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. [[Tarifa]] is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are: [[bottlenose dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[striped dolphin]], [[pilot whale]], [[sperm whale]], [[fin whale]] and [[orca]].

In the Canary Islands it is possible to see these and others, such as the [[blue whale]], [[Bryde's whale]], [[beaked whale]], [[false killer whale]], [[Risso's dolphin]], [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]] and [[rough-toothed dolphin]].

In [[Iceland]] it is possible to see whales in [[Eyjafjordur]], Skjalfandifloi and Faxafloi. The towns offering whale watching are [[Dalvík|Dalvik]], Hauganes, Húsavik, and Reykjavik.  Most common are [[minke whale]], [[humpback whale]], [[Atlantic white-sided dolphin]], [[blue whale]], and [[harbour porpoise]].

=== Northwest Atlantic ===
[[File:Humpback stellwagen edit.jpg|thumb|A humpback breaching in the [[Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary]].  This is a behavior commonly seen in the area.|alt=Photo of whale with head in the air and two-thirds of its body out of the water, falling onto its back]]

In [[New England]] and off the east coast of [[Long Island]] in the United States, the whale watching season typically takes place from about mid-spring through October, depending both on weather and precise location. It is here that the [[humpback whale]], [[fin whale]], [[minke whale]], and the very endangered/heavily protected [[North Atlantic right whale]] are often observed. For generations, areas like the [[Gulf of Maine]] and [[Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary]] (part of the inner waters formed by [[Cape Cod]]'s hooked shape) have been important feeding grounds for these species: to this day a very large portion of the waters off the Eastern Seaboard are rich in [[sand lance]] and other nutritious treats for mothers to teach their calves to feed on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt;

In the past this area was the US whaling industry's capital, particularly [[Nantucket]], an island just off the coast of [[Massachusetts]]. Though strict laws prohibit molestation of these large wild mammals, it is not unknown for the whales to approach whale watching boats uninvited, particularly curious calves and juveniles: it is not unknown in particular, for example, for juvenile humpbacks to approach the boat and [[spyhop]] to get a better look at the humans aboard. In recent years it is also not uncommon to see these animals playing and feeding in harbors, including [[New York City]] or [[Boston]] where fish species of interest to the whales have lately returned in astonishing numbers. As of 2011, an expert from [[Cornell University]] has recorded the vocalizations of six whale species including the humpback, the fin whale, and the massive [[blue whale]] within close proximity of the [[Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge]] in the lower portion of [[New York Harbor]] and there is at least one company offering  marine life tours out of The [[Rockaway Peninsula]] in Queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PZAF7bk8Ol4| Whales in the NY Harbor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Httpwwwnydailynewscomny_local_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_cityhtml&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/30/2011-01-30_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_city.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Whales return to New York City: Massive mammals appearing again in seas near city; draws sightseers | first=Barbara | last=Ross | date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these increasingly frequent visits, new laws address the safety of boaters, commercial fishermen, and the whales themselves: off the coast of Boston, for example, cargo vessels must slow down to protect the much slower [[North Atlantic right whale]] and there is talk of erecting an apparatus for the much more heavily trafficked waters surrounding [[New York City]] that can warn boats of a whale's presence and location so as to avoid accidentally striking the animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Httpwwwnydailynewscomny_local_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_cityhtml&quot; /&gt; Because of the relative diversity of whales and dolphins within easy access of shore, cetacean research takes place at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], and the [[Riverhead Foundation]] among other centers.

[[File:Whale watching Tadoussac 11.jpg|thumb|Whale watching near Tadoussac]]
Eastern [[Canada]] has many whale watching tours in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]] or [[New Brunswick]]. Twenty-two species of whales and dolphins frequent the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, although the most common are the humpback, minke, fin, Beluga and killer whales.  Another popular whale-watching area is at [[Tadoussac, Quebec]], where Belugas favor the extreme depth and admixture of cold fresh water from the [[Saguenay River]] into the inland end of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. Humpbacks, minkes, fin and blue whales are also frequently seen off Tadoussac.The  [[Bay of Fundy]] is an equally important feeding ground for large baleen whales and dozens of other creatures of the sea; it shares a population of migrating humpbacks with America and is a known summer nursery for mother right whales with calves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt;

On the east coast of the [[United States]], Virginia Beach, Virginia whale watching is a winter activity from the end of December until the middle of March. Fin, humpback, and right Whales are seen off the Virginia Beach coast on whale watching boat trips run by the [[Virginia Aquarium]] and Marine Science Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitvirginiabeach.com/visitors/explore/articles/whale-watching|title=Whale Watching in Virginia Beach brings giant thrills.|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sightings are mostly of juveniles who stay near the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] where food is plentiful, while the adults continue to the Caribbean to mate.  &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot; pick up their offspring on the way back north where the whole family summers.

[[File:2017 Sarasota Adventure Kayak Guided Tour Cormorant among the Fleet 04 FRD 9405.jpg|thumb|Ecotour guide stands on a kayak spotting dolphins and manatees, around [[Lido Key]]]]

Ecotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity in warm-water vacation destinations such as [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota Keys]]. Guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch [[dolphin]]s breach and [[manatee]]s eat sea grass, in shallow bay water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kayak Coasting, SRQ Magazine(2015)|url=http://www.srqmagazine.com/articles/146/Kayak-Coasting|accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waters surrounding Virginia are also a known migration corridor for the endangered [[North Atlantic right whale]]: Pregnant females must pass through this area around December to reach their birthing grounds down the coast in Georgia and Florida. For these reasons  the waters between the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and the barrier islands that stretch southwards towards northern Florida must be monitored every winter and spring as mothers give birth to their calves, nurse them, and then ready themselves and their younglings to return north for the cooler waters near New England and Canada.

=== Caribbean ===
About 25 species are observed in the Caribbean waters such as Humpback whales, Sperm whales, beaked whales and many other small cetaceans. Principle whale watch activities : Dominican Republic, East Caribbean islands. Caribwhale, the Caribbean whale watch association, include operators engaged in a sustainable whale watching activity, experts, conservationists and research groups as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Dalhousie University and Association Evasion Tropicale.

=== Northern Indian Ocean ===
On the South and East Coasts of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[The Maldives]], the industry is growing. During winter and summer, [[sperm whales]] cross the southern tip of the island, migrating to the warmer waters of Southeast Asia. So do [[pygmy blue whale]]s.

Many pygmy blue whales can be seen at Dondra point in Sri Lanka. You can access it through the [[Mirissa]] Harbour or [[Weligama]] Harbour. Whale watching tours can be arranged via many in Sri Lanka.

The sea of [[Mirissa]] is the place where you can see blue whales and few types of dolphins while travelling in Sri Lanka. Many sightings have been reported in November to April in the year.

=== Northeast Pacific ===
[[File:Watching Orcas (Monterey, 2007).jpg|thumb|Watching [[orca]]s in [[Monterey Bay]]]]
On the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where orca pods are sometimes visible from shore.  Three types of orca pods can be observed during the summer months in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglewingtours.com/orca-killer-whales|title=Killer Whales in Victoria, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Oregon Coast]], several whale species, especially [[gray whale]]s, may be seen year-round, and the state trains volunteers to assist tourists in the winter months, during whale migration season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whalespoken.org/|title=Oregon Parks &amp; Recreation Dept.: Whale Watching Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[California]], good whale-watching can be found year-round on the Southern California coast. During the winter and spring (December–May), [[gray whale]]s can be seen from shore on their annual migration (the best spot being [[Point Vicente Light|Point Vicente]]), while [[blue whale]]s are often seen between July and October. [[Fin whales]], [[minke whales]], [[orcas]], and various species of dolphins can be seen year-round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whale Watching in the Northeast Pacific: California Coast|url=http://2seewhales.com/california-coast-whale-watching-facts/|publisher=2SeeWhales|accessdate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spring, summer, and fall at the [[Farallon Islands]] off [[San Francisco]], one may see [[Humpback Whale|humpbacks]], [[Gray Whale|grays]], and [[Blue Whale|blue whales]]. In [[Mexico]], the various [[lagoon]]s of [[Baja California Sur]] become breeding habitat in February and March. A number of towns in the [[Mexican state]] celebrate the whale's arrival with festivals such as [[Guerrero Negro]], in the first half of February and the port of [[San Blas, Baja California Sur|San Blas]] on 24 and 25 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;MexDesOax&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last= Quintanar Hinojosa |first=Beatriz  |date=August 2007 |title=Oaxaca: jubilo de los sentidos |journal=Guía México Desconocido: Oaxaca |volume= 137  |page=8  |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Pacific ===
Each winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific humpback whales migrate from [[Alaska]] to [[Hawaii]]. In the vast waters that line Alaska's coast, an encounter with a whale is likely, if not downright predictable. In the summer, after thousands of whales have made their way to the rich feeding grounds of Alaska waters, sightings are extremely common.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the [[Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary]]. The best places to see whales in Hawaiʻi is in the protected channels between the Hawaiʻian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/involved/pdfs/Part1_2010OCReport.pdf|title=Sanctuary Ocean Count: Analysis of Humpback Whale Census and Behavior Data 2002–2010|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovebigisland.com/big-island-whale-watching/#whale-season|title=Whale sighting statistics for the island of Hawaiʻi|website=Lovebigisland|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
{{Main|Whaling in the Philippines}}
Many countries in Asia have large whale watching industries.  In 2008 the largest, in terms of number of tourists, were mainland China, Taiwan and Japan.  India, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives also have dolphin watching and some whale watching. China’s dolphin watching is almost entirely focussed on Sanniang Bay in [[Guangxi]].  Taiwan has several whale watching ports on its east coast.  Japan has a range of whale and dolphin watching businesses on all main islands and [[Okinawa]], Zamami, Ogasawara, Mikura-Jima and Miyake-jima.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S., Campbell, R., Cortez, H., &amp; Knowles, T., 2009, Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits, a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA, prepared by Economists at Large. Page 120 http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], over thirty species of whales and dolphins can be observed around [[Pamilacan]] in Central [[Visayas]], [[Davao Gulf]], the northern coast of the province-island [[Babuyan Islands]] in [[Batanes]], [[Pasaleng Bay]], and [[Malampaya Sound]], [[Palawan]]. The Visayas is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the [[Fraser's dolphin]] in the world. Dolphin species in the Visayas are attracted to fish lures and to commercial fishing operations. In the northernmost province of Batanes, at least 12 species of whales and dolphins has been sighted, making it the single location in the country with the highest cetacean diversity. There seems to be no specific whale watching season in the Philippines, although the calmer waters of the summer season typically provides the best conditions. Some populations, like those of the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]], [[Bryde's whale]], and [[humpback whale]]s in Batanes, appear migratory. Other populations have yet to be studied. Some former coastal whaling communities in the Philippines have also started to generate whale watching income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.org.ph/wwf3/news/1|title=WWF-Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], [[whale shark]]s can be observed in Nabire of [[Western New Guinea|Papua]] region.

{{Main|Whale watching in Australia|Whale watching in New Zealand}}
[[Kaikoura]] in [[New Zealand]] is a world-famous whale-watching site (in particular [[sperm whale]]s). The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the [[sperm whale]] watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader; arguably the most developed in the world. The town, like many around the world, went into recession after the collapse of the [[whaling industry]]. Its recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of whale watching over [[whale hunting]].

The [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] and [[Hervey Bay]] (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] offer reliable whale watching conditions for [[Humpback whale|southern humpback whales]] from the end of June through to the end of November each year. Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years.{{When|date=October 2012}} [[Sydney]], [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]], [[Narooma]] and [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in [[New South Wales]] are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.

Southern right whales are seen June–August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around [[Encounter Bay]] near [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]] and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the [[Great Australian Bight]] near [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]].

== Whaling and whale watching ==
The three major whaling nations ([[Norway]], [[Japan]] and [[Iceland]]) have large and growing whale watching industries. Indeed, Iceland had the fastest-growing whale watching industry in the world between 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt;

=== Japan ===
[[File:Illustration of Whale 1, Edo period, 18th-19th century, color on paper - Tokyo National Museum - DSC05512.JPG|thumb|[[Humpback whale]] illustration from the [[Edo period]], 18th-19th century]]
[[Erich Hoyt]] and other conservationists argue that a whale is worth more alive and watched than dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt; The goal is to persuade their governments to curtail whaling activities. This debate continues at the [[International Whaling Commission]], particularly since whaling countries complain that the scarcity of [[whale meat]] and other products has increased their value. However, the whale meat market has collapsed, and in Japan the government subsidizes the market through distribution in schools and other promotion. In 1997, 2,000 tonnes of whale meat were sold for $30m – a 10-tonne [[Minke Whale]] would thus have been worth $150,000. There is no agreement as to how to value a single animal although its true value is probably much higher. However, it is clear from most coastal communities that are involved in whale watching that profits can be made and are more horizontally distributed throughout the community than if the animals were killed by the whaling industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157&quot; /&gt;
*There have been disputes and skirmishes between whale watching operators and whalers in the nation. For example, whaling was operated right in front of watching vessels, causing malaise among domestic and international passengers on board, and domestic disputes spread on the Internet in [[Nemuro Strait]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mainichi Shimbun]], 2007, ＜クジラ＞ウオッチングの観光客の目前で捕獲 知床沖&lt;/ref&gt; Local tour operators confirmed that targeted species for hunting such as Baird's Beaked Whales and [[Dall's Porpoise]]s are known to disappear or have become harder to approach in the seasons of whaling operations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Shiretoko Nature Cruise&lt;/ref&gt; Recent notable declines and disappearances (or abandoning of historical habitats) of [[Minke Whale|Minke]] and [[Baird's Beaked Whale]]s in coastal waters caused by commercial and scientific whaling that have been operated in wide ranges off the eastern half of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] especially off [[Abashiri]], Gulf of [[Sendai]], and along the coast of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], caused dramatic decreases in sightings of both species in many areas, enough for whalers to be forced to change their operating ranges, and a watching operator in [[Muroran]] claimed that whaling affected the profits of the operator due to serious declines and low rates of successful minke sightings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk-elm.jp/|title=トップページ - イルカ・鯨ウォッチングとフィッシングのKKエルム - 株式会社エルム|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting of Baird's Beaked Whales in [[Sea of Japan]] has ceased in recent decades, and the whales have been said to have become more friendly during this period; however, commercial whaling was resumed in Sea of Japan and caused concerns among cetacean conservationists.
*The first whale watching in Japan was conducted in [[Bonin Islands]] in 1998 by a group called &quot;Geisharen ''鯨者連''&quot; which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as [[Roger Payne]], Erich Hoyt, Richard Oliver, Jim Darling, John Ford, Kyusoku Iwamoto (cartoonist), Hutoushiki Ueki (science writer), Nobuyuki Miyazaki (head chief of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of The [[University of Tokyo]]), Nobuaki Mochizuki (one of the world's first whale photographers to record a living [[North Pacific right whale]] underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), and Junko Sakuma (freelancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kyusoku Iwamoto|title=僕が出会った世界のクジラ人たち|url=http://www24.big.or.jp/~kyusoku/w_peapl.htm|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time until before the group reach the destination, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)]] and other groups and anonymous individuals watched the group's movements and tried to pressure them not to conduct the tour.&lt;ref name=Obara1996&gt;Hideo Obara, 1996, 『人間は野生動物を守れるか』(book), [[Iwanami Shoten, Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including [[pinniped]]s, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including [[C. W. Nicol]], who was a sympathizer with Japan's whaling industries) or domestic media that have done reporting assignments&lt;ref&gt;[[Aera (magazine)]], (2008) 『捕鯨ナショナリズム煽る農水省の罪』&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan had been discriminated.&lt;ref name=Obara1996 /&gt; These include a former fisherman who was ostracized from the community, later to become a whale-watching operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BlueVoice.org]]|title=From Dolphin Hunting to Dolphin Watching|url=http://www.bluevoice.org/news_dolphinwatching.php|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters in places such as [[Abashiri]] and [[Muroto]].

=== Iceland ===
[[File:BlueWhaleWithCalf.jpg|thumb|[[Blue whale]] with Calf, [[Ólafsvík]], Iceland]]
Upon the resumption of whaling in Iceland in August 2003, pro-whaling groups, such as fishermen who argue that increased stocks of whales deplete fish populations, suggested that sustainable whaling and whale watching could live side-by-side. Whale watching lobbyists, such as [[Húsavík]] Whale Museum curator Asbjorn Bjorgvinsson, counter that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats very closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken. Pro-whaling organisations such as the [[High North Alliance]] on the other hand, claim that some whale-watching companies in Iceland are surviving only because they receive funding from anti-whaling organizations.

=== Norway ===
[[File:Tysfjord orca 1.jpg|thumb|[[Orca]] near [[Tysfjord]], Norway]]
Enjoyment of observing live cetaceans is rather separated from the domestic whaling industry in Norway; however, whale watching has become a popular national tourist attraction in recent years, especially in [[Andfjorden]] ([[Vesterålen]] and [[Troms]]) and around [[Tromsø]].
*Uniquely, public opinions against whaling showed sudden rises in 2014, when a possibly pregnant [[Minke Whale]] ''Heiko'', named after [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]] the [[Orca]] and a local cetacean researcher Heike Vester who monitors the whale's safety, successfully shook off whaling vessels by taking refuge in the very shallow fjord of [[Lofoten]], where large whales had not been seen for years; this has provided chances for locals to witness cetaceans at close range. Heiko's appearance soon resulted in an increase in interest among locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McEnally C.|year=2014|title=After Escaping Whaling Ships, One Whale is Changing Norwegian Attitudes on Whale Meat|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/heiko-the-minke-whale-is-changing-norwegian-attitudes-on-whale-meat/|publisher=The One Green Planet|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, Heiko attracted more domestic and international interest, which has resulted in greater questioning and opposition to the whaling industry in Norway.

In comparison, the government of the [[Azores]] has promoted an economic policy centred on tourism that includes whale watching. With the decline of whaling in the early 1970s in the islands, many of the communities of the archipelago involved in whaling (including villages and towns, specifically on the islands of [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[Terceira]], [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] and [[Pico Island|Pico]]) were transformed into hubs for whale watching services (that followed the migratory tracts during the summer), while older buildings and factories were re-purposed into museums.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

There are at least 28 species of [[cetacean]]s &amp;mdash; 7 [[baleen whale]]s and 21 [[toothed whale]]s &amp;mdash; in [[Gulf of Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227550699_A_review_of_cetacean_occurrence_in_West_African_waters_from_the_Gulf_of_Guinea_to_Angola&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific approaches to cetacean diversities have not been taken until recently, and 18 species were confirmed during researches.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/243176.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Ghana’s [[coast]] of 550&amp;nbsp;km from [[Aflao]] to [[Axim]] is part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] which has a humpback whale breeding stock with a population of over 10,000 individuals. These strandings show a peak abundance of breeding humpbacks in these waters. An increase in the strandings in recent years are a result of other population dynamics or an increase in human coverage and reporting.

== Types of whales ==
[[Whales]] in Ghanaian marine environment belong to species of families [[Ziphiidae]] (beaked whales), [[Physeteridae]] (sperm whales) and [[Kogiidae]] (pygmy sperm whales). '[[Dolphin]]s', and other species recorded along western African waters but not within Ghanaian waters such as [[blue whale]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ketosecology.co.uk/blue-whales-angola-new-publication/&lt;/ref&gt; [[bryde's whale]]s, and [[minke whale]]s&lt;ref name=imisdocs&gt;http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/243181.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; are not listed below. Most common of dolphins along Ghanaian waters include Atlantic [[humpback dolphin]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ketosecology.co.uk/benin/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[common bottlenose dolphin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ketosecology.co.uk/new-publication-dolphins-in-guinea-bissau/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Melon-headed whales ===
[[Melon-headed whale]]s are accidentally caught in Ghana waters. Specimens have been landed in Shama in 1994 and four in [[Dixcove]] in 2000 and 2002. An adult-sized pygmy killer whale landed at Dixcove in December 2007 is the first documented record in the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Van Waerebeek K, Ofori-Danson PK, Debrah J (2009).
The cetaceans of Ghana: a validated faunal checklist. West African Journal of Applied Ecology 15, 61–90&lt;/ref&gt; Status is unknown but, as elsewhere, pygmy killer whales are probably rare.

=== False killer whales ===
Records of [[false killer whale]]s in Ghana is not abundant while the species regularly appears in the Gulf waters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ketosecology.co.uk/false-killer-whale/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namibiandolphinproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Weir-et-al-2013_False-killer-whales-in-Gulf-of-Guinea.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilot whales ===
[[Short-finned pilot whale]]s seem to be common in Ghana marine waters, and also occur off the coast of [[Côte d’Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cadenat, 1959)World Register of Marine Species&lt;/ref&gt; Short-finned pilot whales are irregular by-catch victims in drift gill nets off Ghana (3.5% of cetacean catches,&lt;ref&gt;Ofori-Danson PK, Van Waerebeek K, Debrah S (2003).
A survey for the conservation of dolphins in Ghanaian coastal waters. Journal of the Ghana Science Association
5, 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was landed at Shama, [[Axim]] and [[Dixcove]].
Most specimens are too big to haul onboard artisanal fishing boats and are towed to port. The Vridi specimen was harpooned for research purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadenat 1959&quot;&gt;Cadenat (1959) World Register of Marine Species&lt;/ref&gt; A single skeletal specimen was known for Ghana and was probably collected in 1956.

=== Killer whales ===
[[Killer whale]]s are present in Gulf of Guinea waters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surfbirds.com/community-blogs/amigo/2014/08/19/humpback-and-killer-whales-in-the-gulf-of-guinea/&lt;/ref&gt; although population size is not considered in great numbers.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7923647&lt;/ref&gt; A killer whale was harpooned some 15-20&amp;nbsp;nm south of Abidjan in 1958 but the animal sank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cadenat 1959&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;marinespecies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species|publisher=marinespecies.org|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that killer whales are present in the West African marine waters. Observers on industrial tuna purse-seiners reported a few sightings off the coast of Liberia, Ivory Coast and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond and Lockyer, 1988). Distribution of killer whales in the eastern North Atlantic. Rit Fiskideildar 11, 24–41&lt;/ref&gt;
The first record in Ghana comprises three false killer whales landed at Apam in 2003. Skulls were collected from a false killer whale stranded near Assini, Côte d’Ivoire, in 1970 (van Bree, 1972) and from a specimen in Benin.&lt;ref&gt;(Van Waerebeek et al, 2001; Tchibozo and Van Waerebeek, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuvier's beaked whale ===
[[Cuvier's beaked whale]] (Ziphius cavirostris) Offshore Cuvier's beaked whale is a cosmopolitan ziphiid found in pelagic tropical to warm temperate waters. A juvenile landed at Axim in 1994 is the first documented beaked whale in the Gulf of Guinea. The status of Cuvier’s beaked whale is unknown, but no threats are identified. The single capture in Ghana among hundreds of other small cetaceans&lt;ref&gt;Debrah JA, Ofori-Danson PK, Van Waerebeek K (2010). An update on the catch composition and other aspects of cetacean exploitation in Ghana. IWC Scientific Committee document SC/62/SM10, Agadir, Morocco, Jun 2010&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that impact from bycatch is probably negligible.

=== Sperm whales ===
In [[Ghana]], a dwarf [[sperm whale]] was taken by fishermen from [[Apam]] in 1998. Two unidentified Kogia sp. were landed, one at Shama in 1994 and another at Apam in 2003. Very little information is available on [[sperm whale]]s in the Gulf of Guinea, however females and juveniles are believed to be present throughout the year beyond the [[continental shelf]]. This is because two dead sperm whales were washed ashore, first near [[Accra]] in 1994 and a second at [[Dixcove]] in 2002.

=== Humpback whale ===
Irvine 1947&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Irvine, M. D. Scott (1987) “Social Structure in Migrating Humpback Whales (Megapteranovaeangliae).”&lt;/ref&gt; recorded a possible humpback whale at Prampram in September 1938.

&lt;/ref&gt; encountered several pods including a mother and possible newborn calf in Ghanaian waters in October 2006. From the presence of humpback whales exclusively from early August till late November, and the frequent observations of neonates and ‘competitive groups’, it is evident that the continental shelf of [[Benin]], Togo, Ghana, and western [[Nigeria]] hosts a breeding/calving population with a Southern Hemisphere seasonality,&lt;ref&gt;Van Waerebeek K (2003). A newly discovered population of humpback whales in the northern Gulf of Guinea. CMS Bulletin 18, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as the ‘Gulf of Guinea stock’. Its parametric distribution suggests it may be related to the IWC-defined breeding stock ‘B’ from central-west Africa.&lt;ref&gt;(International Whaling Commission  (1997) Journal of Cetacean Research and Management: Special Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/243239.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Mother and calf pairs have been sighted exclusively near shore in Benin, sometimes just beyond the surf-zone. The westernmost authenticated record is a stranding at Assini Mafia, eastern Côte d’Ivoire in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Tchibozo S, Van Waerebeek K (2007). La baleine à bosse et le lamantin d’Afrique, des potentielles ressources de tourisme de la nature au Bénin. Poster presentation, WATCH Symposium; 16–20 Oct 2007, Adeje, Tenerife, Spain (Van Waerebeek et al, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, small-scale, seasonal humpback whale-watching sorties have been conducted from the ports of Sekondi-Takoradi, Lomé and Cotonou.&lt;ref&gt;Van Waerebeek K, Tchibozo S, Montcho J et al.(2001). The Bight of Benin, a North Atlantic breeding ground of a Southern Hemisphere humpback whale population, likely related to Gabon and Angola substocks. IWC Scientific Committee document SC/53/IA21; Jul 2010, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The breeding stock off [[Gabon]] and [[Angola]] is the subject of longterm dedicated studies.&lt;ref&gt;Best PB (2007) Whales and Dolphins of the Southern African Subregion. Cambridge University Press, Cape Town, South Africa&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly up to 10% of world population of humpbacks migrate into Gulf of Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;http://mayumbanationalpark.com/cetaceans.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

No abundance estimate is available for the [[Bight of Benin]] population, but the encounter rate in October 2000 was approximately 5.9 humpback whales per 100&amp;nbsp;km surveyed  (0.109/nautical mile) .&lt;ref&gt;Van Waerebeek K, Tchibozo S, Montcho J et al. (2001). The Bight of Benin, a North Atlantic breeding ground of a Southern Hemisphere humpback whale population, likely related to Gabon and Angola substocks.

Jul 2010, London&lt;/ref&gt;
The reported [[neonates]] stranded in unknown circumstances of natural and anthropogenic causes are possible. At least some humpback whale strandings in the area are thought to be animals killed in vessel collisions, which may be far more common in African waters than scarce reports suggest.&lt;ref&gt;(Félix and Van Waerebeek, 2005; Van Waerebeek et al, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Humpback whales near Cotonou’s harbour entrance and crossing the main shipping lanes, incur obvious risk. The individual that stranded at Assini Mafia was reported with external trauma consistent with a propeller hit.&lt;ref&gt;Tchibozo S, Van Waerebeek K (2007). La baleine à

About five of the whales which died are hunchbacks which were stranded in Ghanaian waters. Ghana’s coast forms part of the distribution range of a ‘[[Gulf of Guinea]]’ [[humpback whale]] breeding stock with estimated population at over 10,000 individuals.

== Paths of whales ==
[[Ghana]] is on a path of migration for whales heading from [[South Africa]] to the waters off [[Great Britain|Britain]] and with the current flowing east, whatever killed the whales could be off the [[coast]] of [[Ivory Coast]] or further east.
Some whales from the eastern North Atlantic migrate to the tropical coast of western Africa and the Cape Verde Islands&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hwrf-uk.org/About-humpback-whales.html&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods are used including satellite tags which can track whale movements in near real time. It is not known why humpback whales migrate although possible suggestions include predator avoidance and the energetic benefits of warm water during the winter when food production is low in the feeding grounds. Swimming off the coast of [[Africa]], humpback whales encounter more than warm waters for mating and bearing young, according to a new study led by the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (WCS). They also encounter offshore oil rigs, major shipping routes and potentially harmful toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1113065085/humpback-whales-human-activities-overlap-southeast-atlantic-020614/#55UJ1bWoZ6Deoo3f.99&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of whales ==
Most of the deaths of the whales have occurred at the coast of the Western Region of [[Ghana]] and raised fears that it was the oil drilling that is responsible for the deaths. Since the discovery of oil in 2007 some environmentalists are skeptical whether oil and gas will be handled judiciously to avoid environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Collier (2012), One Year of Oil and Gas production in Ghana. Speech made at University of Ghana New Year School&lt;/ref&gt; Decomposed whale carcasses have been washing onto beaches in western region making environmental groups worried the country's growing petroleum industry may be killing marine life. Local people count a total of 20 dead whales discovered along Ghana's [[coastline]] in the last four years, including at least eight since September 2013. Whales are [[mammals]] and what kills them is still unresolved.

=== Causes of death of whales ===
Speculations on the causes of death have generated heated arguments. Some Ghanaians believe that with the start of the exploration of oil and gas in 2007 to 2010 eleven whales have died within three years. They believe that [[seismic]] [[air guns]] used for oil exploration generate so much [[noise]] that if a whale goes [[deaf]] it cannot survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;modernghana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/green-groups-concerned-over-ghana-whale|title=Search this website|publisher=modernghana.com|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[academia]] is not sure of the causes of death of the whales. &quot;It's definitely unusual. But what may be the cause we can't put our finger on,&quot; said A.K. Armah,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/ALeqM5gTSRM-FH32Uks_jAvrmzRdnr4esA&lt;/ref&gt; a [[lecturer]] at the [[University of Ghana]], who studies [[marine life]].

“It is important to note that dead whales that have been washed ashore in Ghana were in a decomposed state and, therefore, samples could not be taken for laboratory analysis to ascertain the cause of death,” the Ministry of Fisheries and the Fisheries Commission said in a joint statement signed by the sector Minister, Mr [[Nayon Bilijo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghanaweb.com › News › 2013-09-09&lt;/ref&gt; The Fisheries Commission said: “The cause of death of the whales is not due to negligence or inaction on the part of competent authorities responsible for the regulation and management of the Ghanaian marine waters”. It explained that the death of a whale could be due to ageing, infectious disease related to bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infection or non-infectious diseases related to failure of internal organs.

The Environmental Protection Agency officials took samples of the carcass for analyses. The Agency said the incidence of whales being washed ashore was a global occurrence and not limited to Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;ghanaoilwatch.org/ghana./3305-epa-activities-of-oil-companies-not&lt;/ref&gt; From February 2011 to September 2, 2013, over 120 different types of whales have been reported washed ashore at various locations around the globe&quot;, a statement from the Public Affairs Department of the EPA said. The EPA said after the discovery of the five dead whales last year that the situation was &quot;of much concern&quot; but it was not unprecedented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov.gh/dead whales washed ashore&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that whales and other [[marine mammals]] rely on their hearing to find food, friends and mating partners and when a very powerful sound fills their ears this can reorient them.
The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] an environmental advocacy group believes that oil and gas exploration is leading to overwhelming whale deaths in the Gulf of Guinea. Similar cases have happened in the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Hawaii]]. There is a belief that ocean noise&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhm.ac.uk › Nature online › Life › Mammals&lt;/ref&gt; presents a significant threat to marine mammals and other marine species.

The head of the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]'s whale programme, Patrick Ramage&lt;ref name=&quot;spyghana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/2-whales-found-dead-on-shores-of-ghana/|title=2 Whales found dead on shores of Ghana - SpyGhana.com|publisher=spyghana.com|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; said collisions with ships, water pollution and seismic activity from oil drilling can kill or disorient whales.

=== Local reaction ===
The local people along the beach have reacted to the deaths in a variety of ways. On November 21, 2013, people of Domunli, a coastal community in the Nzema East Municipality in the Western Region, held a funeral for a 10.4&amp;nbsp;meter long dead sperm whale that has washed ashore at the beach. This was the 21st dead whale washed ashore on the coast of Ghana since 2009. The Chief Fishermen and elders from nearby communities [[Axim]] and Egyan got together to pour [[libation]] and say prayers to the gods to help them unravel the mystery of the rampant washing ashore of dead whales. Community members complained to the EPA that the rampant washing ashore of dead whales was rather bad omen for the fisher folks and coastal communities and that they needed answers from them as to what was the cause.

In the case of the dead whale washed up in Nkontompo, local fishermen hauled the carcass to the beach where they dug a hole. It was then buried after pouring libation. Being an uncommon event for the local community, crowds of curious people had gathered to catch a glimpse of the dead mammal.

== Public calls ==
The increased rate of [[whales]] death became great concern to the general public. Environmental Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) Chiefs and people have called on institutions such as the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), Fisheries Commission (FC), Ghana Navy, Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI), Ministry of Energy (MoE) and Ministry of Fisheries (MoF) to investigate the causes of the deaths and find lasting solutions to this problem.

'''Whale watching in Australia''' is a popular recreational pursuit and a tourist activity along various coasts. In 2008, whale and [[dolphin]] watching was worth an estimated {{AUD}}31&amp;nbsp;million in direct expenditure to the [[Australian economy]] with an estimated 1.6&amp;nbsp;million tourists participating in the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching|title=Whale and dolphin watching|year=2014|accessdate=4 May 2014|publisher=[[Department of the Environment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Whaling in Australia]] took place from 1788 to 1978 and was once commercially successful. The [[Australian Whale Sanctuary]] was established in 1999 to protect dolphins and whales from hunting.  [[Humpback whale]]s are the most common species seen in the waters surrounding Australia while [[Southern right whale]]s, [[Minke whale]]s and [[Blue whale]]s are also seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtsw&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/where-to-spot-whales-in-sydney-20140523-zrlzx.html |title=Where to spot whales in Sydney |author=Nicky Phillips |accessdate=2 June 2014 |date=23 May 2014 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== West coast ==
[[File:WhalesKGS.webm|thumb|Whales breaching in King George Sound September 2015]]
In [[Western Australia]], whales are watched near [[Cape Naturaliste]] in the south-east [[Indian Ocean]] and at [[Cape Leeuwin]] where the Indian and [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] Oceans meet. Whale watching cruises operate along the west coast around [[Perth]] and [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and as far north as [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/Things_to_See_and_Do/Sun_Surf_and_Sea_Life/Pages/Whale_Watching.aspx|title=Whale watching|year=2013|accessdate=4 May 2014|publisher=Tourism Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Southern Australia ==
In the [[Southern Ocean]] there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. 
[[Southern Right Whale]]s are seen June–August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around [[Encounter Bay]] near [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]] and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the [[Great Australian Bight]] near [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]].
[[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] a popular site is Logan's Beach at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], as well as in the waters off [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140914141221/http://www.abc.net.au/oceans/whale/spot.htm Whale Dreams: Spotting whales in Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tasmania]] whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|River Derwent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travelmedia.tourismtasmania.com.au/about/wildlife/whales.html Tourism Tasmania :: Media Site :: About :: Whales &amp;amp; Dolphins]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Australia]] whales are watched in the [[Great Australian Bight]] Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-watching/see-whales.html |title=Where to see whales and dolphins in the wild |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=2009-01-12 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217042536/http://www.environment.gov.au/coasts/species/cetaceans/whale-watching/see-whales.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 }}

In [[East Coast of Australia|eastern Australia]], whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into [[Sydney Harbour]].  New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site. At Cape Solander in the south of [[Botany Bay]] community volunteers participate in a long-term scientific study.  Each year from the 24 May until the 1 August they count whales swimming past from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwinsw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/animals/whalewatchinginnsw.htm |title=Whale watching in NSW |date=31 January 2014 |publisher=Environment and Heritage |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] and [[Hervey Bay]] (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in [[Queensland]], offer reliable whale watching conditions for [[Humpback whale|Southern Humpback Whale]]s from the end of June through to the end of November each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwhb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racq.com.au/travel/drive_travel/must_dos/fraser-coast/whale_watching,_hervey_bay |title=Whale Watching, Hervey Bay |publisher=RACQ |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hervey Bay is a particularly good spot for whale watching as the whales are not constantly on the move.  Instead they exhibit a range of playful behaviours.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtwp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frasercoast.qld.gov.au/web/our-fraser-coast/whale-watching |title=Where the whales play |work=Our Fraser Coast |publisher=Fraser Coast Regional Council |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year in August Hervey Bay hosts the Whale Festival which marks the beginning of the whale watching season and includes various ceremonies such as blessing the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;hbwf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frasercoast.qld.gov.au/home/-/asset_publisher/2UxW/content/hervey-bay-whale-festival-starts-this-week |title=Hervey Bay Whale Festival starts this week |date=29 July 2013 |publisher=Fraser Coast Regional Council |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years.{{When|date=October 2012}} [[Sydney]], [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]], [[Narooma]] and [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in [[New South Wales]] are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.

 |quote  = Whales transport more nitrogen through their feces in the Gulf of Maine than all of the rivers in that system combined.
 |source = Briana Abrahms&lt;ref name=&quot;Enough N&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservationconnections.blogspot.in/2012/05/importance-of-whale-poop-interview-with.html |title=The Importance of Whale Poop: An Interview with Joe Roman |author=Abrahms, Briana |date=1 June 2012 |website=Conservation Connections  |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Cetaceans are an important source of [[nitrogen]]. A study in the [[Gulf of Maine]] extrapolated from modern levels nitrogen recycling in the sea due to [[marine mammals]], such as [[cetaceans]] and [[Pinniped|seals]], prior to the advent of commercial culling, estimating a former level thrice that of supply of [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere]]. Even today, despite reduction of marine mammal populations and increase in nitrogen uptake from the atmosphere and nitrogen pollution, the local clustering of marine mammals plays a significant role in maintaining the productivity in the regions they frequent.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOSOne&quot;/&gt;  The enrichment is not only in primary productivity but also secondary productivity in the form of abundance in fish populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceDaily&quot;/&gt;

The study assumes that whales tend to defecate more commonly in the upper part of the water column, which they frequent for breathing; additionally the feces tend to float. Whales feed at deeper levels of the ocean where krill is found.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOSOne&quot;/&gt; The fecal action of whales thus reverses the usual flow of nutrients of the ocean's &quot;[[biological pump]]&quot; due to the downward flow of &quot;[[marine snow]]&quot; and other [[detritus]] from surface to bottom. The phenomenon has been termed the &quot;whale pump&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceDaily&quot;/&gt;

The Gulf of Maine study also found that the view of whales and other marine mammals as competitors for fishing, advocated by some nations, is incorrect as whales play a vital role in maintaining the productivity of phytoplankton and consequently  the fish. Culling marine mammal populations threatens the nutrient supply and the productivity of fishing grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceDaily&quot;/&gt;

In addition, the feces of krill-eating whales is rich in [[iron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscoveryNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--slide 5 of 5--&gt; The release of iron from whale feces encourages the growth of [[phytoplankton]] in the sea,&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscoveryNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--slide 3 of 5--&gt; which not only benefits the marine [[food chain]], but also sequesters carbon for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscoveryNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--slide 1 of 5--&gt;  When phytoplankton, which is not consumed in its lifetime, perishes, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] and settles down into the depths of sea. Phytoplankton sequesters an estimated 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the ocean each year, causing the ocean to become a sink of carbon dioxide which holds an estimated 90% of all sequestered carbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarthTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/scitech/role-marine-plankton-sequestration-carbon/1062/|title=The role of marine plankton in sequestration of carbon |author=Campbell, Mike |date=22 June 2011 |website=EarthTimes|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Ocean is amongst the largest ranges for phytoplankton and has the characteristic of being nutrient-rich in terms of  phosphate, nitrate  and silicate, while it is iron-deficient at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceAlert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/features/20141108-26000-2.html |title=Bottoms up: how whale poop helps feed the ocean |author1=Ratnarajah, Lavenia |author2=Bowie, Andrew |author3=Hodgson-Johnson, Indi  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=11 August 2014 |website= Science Alert |accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases of nutrient iron results in blooming of phytoplankton. Whale feces is up to 10 million times richer in iron than the surrounding sea water and plays a vital role in providing the iron required for maintaining phytoplankton biomass on the earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceAlert&quot;/&gt; The iron defecation of just the 12,000 strong [[sperm whale]] population  in the Southern Ocean results in the sequestration of 200,000 tonnes of atmospheric carbon per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceAlert&quot;/&gt;

A study of the Southern Ocean found that whales not only recycled iron concentrations vital for phytoplankton, but also formed, along with krill, a major source of sequestered iron in the ocean, up to 24% of the iron held in the surface waters of Southern Ocean. Whales formed part of a positive feedback loop and if whale populations are allowed to recover in the Southern Ocean,  greater productivity of phytoplankton will result as larger amounts of iron are recycled through the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;NicollEtAl2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00356.x/abstract|title=Southern Ocean iron fertilization by baleen whales and Antarctic krill|authors=Nicol, Stephen; Bowie, Andrew; Jarman, Simon; Lannuzel, Delphine; Meiners, Klaus M &amp; Van Der Merwe, Pier |journal=Fish and Fisheries| volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= 203–209|date=June 2010| accessdate=22 August 2014 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00356.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in the [[Fernando de Noronha Archipelago]] of the southwest [[Atlantic Ocean]], revealed the feces and vomit of [[Spinner dolphin]]s (''Stenella longirostris'') formed part of the diet of twelve species of reef fish from seven different families. The most prolific consumer was the [[black durgon]] (''Melichthys niger''), which could even discern the postures dolphins assumed prior to voiding and positioned themselves for effective feeding. All these offal eating fish species are recorded plankton eaters and it is considered that this type of feeding may represent a change in its usual diet, i.e. drifting plankton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sazimaetal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The cetacean offal connection: Feces and vomits of spinner dolphins as a food source for reef fishes |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/263336964_The_cetacean_offal_connection_Feces_and_vomits_of_spinner_dolphins_as_a_food_source_for_reef_fishes |type=abstract| journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|place=Miami|year=2003|volume=72|issue=1|access-date=26 April 2015|authors=Sazima, Ivan; Sazima, Cristina &amp; Silva, José Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whales, along with other large animals, play a significant role in the transport of nutrients in global ecological cycles. Population reduction of whales and other large animals has severely affected the efficacy of pump mechanisms which transport nutrients from the deep sea to the continental shelves.&lt;ref&gt;

==Whale feces as indicators of health and ecology==
Whale feces contain DNA, hormones, toxins and other chemicals which can give information on a number of aspects of the health, natural history and ecology of the animal concerned. Feces have also provided information on the bacteria present in the gastro-intestinal tract of whales and dolphins.

===Indicator for diet composition===
A 2016 research study used [[fecal analysis]] of wild orcas, which spent the summer season in the [[Salish Sea]], for quantitive estimation of prey species. The analysis was consistent with earlier estimates based on surface prey remains. The study found that salmonids comprised over 98.6% of the identified genetic sequences with [[Chinook salmon|Chinook]] and [[coho salmon]] species as the most important prey species.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrockerFord2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crocker|first1=Daniel E|last2=Ford|first2=Michael J.|last3=Hempelmann|first3=Jennifer|last4=Hanson|first4=M.

===As indicator for population decline===
A research study, published in 2012, on impacts of overfishing and maritime traffic on a wild population of the Southern Resident Killer Whales of the western seaboard of North America, was based on the chemical analysis of fecal specimens  of orcas. The study aimed to find out the reasons for orca decline for which three causes were hypothesized - disturbance by boats and ships, lack of food, and, long-term exposure of toxins which accumulate in whale fat, namely DDT, PBDT and PCB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayres et al (2012)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036842 |title=Distinguishing the Impacts of Inadequate Prey and Vessel Traffic on an Endangered Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) Population | authors=Ayres, Katherine L.; Rebecca K. Booth; Jennifer A. Hempelmann; Kari L. Koski; Candice K. Emmons; Robin W. Baird; Kelley Balcomb-Bartok; M. Bradley Hanson; Michael J. Ford &amp; Samuel K. Wasser |year=2012 | journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=6 |accessdate=10 Apr 2015 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0036842 | pages=e36842 | pmid=22701560 | pmc=3368900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fecal samples of orca were detected with the help of a trained spotter dog, a black [[labrador retriever]], named &quot;Tucker&quot;, from a firm [[Conservation Canines]]. The dog could detect fresh scat from orcas while following in a boat {{convert|200|to|400|m|ft}} behind a pod of orcas. Fecal samples collected were tested for the presence and quantity of [[DNA]], as well as stress,  nutrition and  reproductive [[hormone]]s, and toxins such as  [[PBDE]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]], and [[DDT]] [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cons Biology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conservationbiology.uw.edu/research-programs/killer-whales/| title=Causes of decline among Southern Resident killer whales : Research overview |website=Center for Conservation Biology|publisher=University of Washington, Seattle|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fecal samples were analysed over time and co-related to boat densities over time and the quantity of Fraser River Chinook salmon, the main constituent of orca diet in those regions. Boat densities and the salmon abundance over time were estimated independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cons Biology&quot;/&gt; [[Glucocorticoid]]s  in orcas rise when the animal faces psychological tension or starvation. The study found that prey is maximum in August, at which time, boats are most abundant. Conversely, the availability of salmon was minimum in late fall when the level of marine boat traffic was also the least. Glucocorticoid levels were highest in the fall when there was a shortage of prey and maximum during August at the height of availability of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cons Biology&quot;/&gt;

Similarly [[thyroid hormone]]s co-relate to nutritional stress, enabling animals to lower metabolism rates to better conserve declining nutrition. The Southern Resident Killer Whales arrive in the study area in spring after having fed on salmons from early spring spawning on other rivers when their thyroid hormone levels are highest. The hormone levels decline as the animals arrive in the study area, plateau during the time of fish availability and decline further during the period of nutritional scarcity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cons Biology&quot;/&gt; The toxin analysis was ongoing at the time of publication of research. So far, presence of congeners of the three toxins in whale feces are found to be proportionate to the levels of these chemicals measured in samples of orca flesh during biopsy.  The results indicate that restoring the abundance and quality of available prey is an important first measure to restoring orca populations in the area under study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cons Biology&quot;/&gt;

An analysis of feces of two dolphin and one whale species led to the discovery of a new species of [[Helicobacter]], namely ''[[Helicobacter cetorum]]'', the bacteria being associated with clinical symptoms and [[gastritis]] in the cetaceans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harperetal2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Harper, Claudia G. ; Whary, Mark T.; Yan Feng; Rhinehart, Howard L.; Wells, Randall S.; Shilu Xu;  Taylor, Nancy S.; &amp; Fox, James G.|title=Comparison of Diagnostic Techniques for ''Helicobacter cetorum'' Infection in Wild Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphins (''Tursiops truncatus'')|journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology| date=July 2003 | volume= 41|issue= 7 |pages= 2842–2848 |doi=10.1128/JCM.41.7.2842-2848.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bryde's Whale - Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|A Bryde's Whale is viewed from Auckland Whale &amp; Dolphin Safari's research vessel the 'Dolphin Explorer' during a whale watching trip into the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park.]]
'''Whale watching in New Zealand''' is predominantly centered around the areas of [[Kaikoura]] and the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. Known as the 'whale capital', Kaikoura is a world-famous [[whale watching]] site, in particular for [[sperm whale]]s which is currently the most abundant of large whales in New Zealand waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.govt.nz/Publications/Appendix%209%20Marine%20Mammals%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marine Mammals and Salmon Farms |website=Epa.govt.nz |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park (just outside [[Auckland]] city) is also a significant whale watching area with a resident population of [[Bryde's whale|Bryde's Whales]] commonly viewed alongside other [[Cetacea|cetaceans]] [[Common dolphin|Common Dolphins]], [[Bottlenose dolphin|Bottlenose Dolphins]] and [[Killer whale|Orca]].  Whale watching is also offered in other locations, often as eco-tours and in conjunction with dolphin watching. Land-based whale watching from New Zealand's last whaling station, which closed in 1964, is undertaken for scientific purposes, mostly by ex-whalers. Some compilations of sighting footages are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxUzsK5eC2ixDWYvpGUsDwA/playlists |title=MrDaniel0816 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Many places that were formerly whaling stations went into recession after the collapse of the whaling industry; New Zealand stopped whaling in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whale watching video|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/getting-involved/home-and-garden/involve-the-family/meet-the-locals-videos/first-series/whale-watching/|publisher=[[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whaling did not stop due to environmental or ethical concerns but because the declining number of whales made the industry uneconomic. Whilst New Zealand protected [[right whale]]s in 1935, it was not until 1978 that all [[marine mammal]]s were protected by law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Te Ara&quot; /&gt; Kaikoura's recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of whale watching over whale hunting and other whale-watching operators such as Auckland Whale &amp; Dolphin Safari have successfully combined scientific research and conservation efforts alongside their commercial offering.  Due to illegal whaling by [[Soviet Union]] (with help of Japan) in the 1970s, recovery state of [[baleen whale]]s migrating to New Zealand coasts were heavily slowed down, far worse than in [[Australia]]n waters, and this contributed to make public images that Kaikoura is the only site for whale watching, and Sperm Whale is the only species can be observed normally. New Zealand is the first nation in the world to protect marine mammals by law.

==Hauraki Gulf==
Largely regarded as one of the most abundant and diverse marine reserves in the world, the [[Hauraki Gulf]] is home to several species of cetaceans, most notably [[Bryde's whale]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Killer whale]]s (Orca), [[Common dolphin|Common Dolphins]] and [[Bottlenose dolphin|Bottlenose Dolphins]].  Situated just off the coast of New Zealand's largest city [[Auckland]], the main whale watching operator [http://www.awads.co.nz/ Auckland Whale &amp; Dolphin Safari] departs from the [[Viaduct Basin|Viaduct Harbour]] and runs daily trips (weather permitting) into the [[Hauraki Gulf Marine Park]].  &lt;gallery perrow=&quot;5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Kaikoura==
The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the sperm whale watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader; arguably the most developed in the world.

The dominant organisation in Kaikoura's whale watching industry is Whale Watch Kaikoura, which is run as a charitable organisation. It takes around 100,000 visitors out by boat per annum, and has an annual turnover of [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]10m.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZH March 14&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Morton|first=Jamie|title=Study questions impact of whale watching|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11228056|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whale Watch Kaikoura began operating in 1987 with a {{convert|6|m}} boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Te Ara&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Jock |title=Whaling – Modern whaling and whale watching |url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/whaling/page-5 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 April 2014 |authorlink=Jock Phillips |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whale watching is also done by air, and the [[Kaikoura Aerodrome]] is mainly used for whale spotting tourist flights by Wings over Whales and Air Kaikoura – Kaikoura Aero Club.

==Tory Channel==
New Zealand's last whaling station was in Whekenui Bay in [[Tory Channel]] in the [[Marlborough Sounds]]. The high cliffs at the entrance of Tory Channel are ideal for land-based whale watching. During the migratory season for whales, the lookout is manned and whales passing [[Cook Strait]] are watched for research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/8757218/Whalers-out-for-the-count|title=Whalers out for the count|work=Stuff|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the volunteers undertaking the work are ex-whalers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/meet-the-locals/2007-episode-27-video-1538486 |title=Whale Watching |publisher=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the location where the first [[Southern right whale]] on main islands sighted since the end of whaling. Cetaceans can be seen in [[Waikawa, Marlborough|Waikawa]], [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturetours.co.nz/new-zealand/Dolphin-Seal-sightings/ |title=New Zealand Dolphins, Seals, Whales cruises in the Marlborough Sounds |publisher=Naturetours.co.nz |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French Pass]], and in [[Abel Tasman National Park]] as well.

Sighting numbers of Southern rights, Humpbacks, [[Blue whale|Blue]]s are showing strong increases in recent years.

[[Southern right whale]]s, Tohora, 'the most important whale to New Zealand' is very slowly, but steadily making come backs to the nation's waters, and they will possibly become one of the most important species for whale watching as well since they are renowned as a target for non-harmful, land-based watching, and will recolonize the shores of the entire New Zealand to become seasonal residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/southern-right-whale-back-in-nz-waters-video-5395784|title=Southern right whale back in NZ waters|work=TVNZ|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Whale Rider]], and &quot;real whale riders&quot; sometimes appear for this species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=165565816789382&amp;set=a.151625964850034.29239.151318038214160&amp;type=3&amp;theater |title=Wade Doak – Timeline Photos |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Southern blue and [[Pygmy blue whale|Pygmy blues]], even before the historic discovery of a forging ground off [[Cape Egmont]], whales have been showing come backs along the coasts especially in Northland waters such as off Bay of Islands, [[Tutukaka]], and Kaikoura. [[Fin whale]]s and [[Sei whale]]s are confirmed in Chatham Rise in good numbers, but less frequently seen in coastal waters. [[Minke whale]]s can be seen off entire nation especially in Bay of Islands, but due to their small size it is not easy to observe them. Beaked whales are occasionally seen. Of these, most frequently observed species are [[Arnoux's beaked whale]]s (once a group of these had become a regular annual to [[Doubtful Sound]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fiordlandkindy.blogspot.jp/2009/04/whales-at-doubtful-sound.html | title = Whales at Doubtful Sound : Photographic images |accessdate=5 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504084933/http://fiordlandkindy.blogspot.jp/2009/04/whales-at-doubtful-sound.html |archivedate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiordlandhelicopters.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Fiordland-Coastal-Newsletter-April-2011.pdf |format=PDF |title=Fiordland Coastal Newsletter |website=Fiordlandhelicopters.co.nz |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gray's beaked whale]]s. New Zealand's coasts are also renowned as prominent habitats for curious, ray-hunting Orcas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2wzDXcjaMQ|title=2014 March   Orca at Maraetai New Zealand|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htzexfbbVoc|title=Beautiful Orcas in New Zealand|work=YouTube|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tail sailing''' refers to the action of [[whale]]s lifting their tales clear of the water for long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whalecoast.wordpress.com/marine-big-5/sailing-tail/|title=Sailing Tail|website=Whale Coast Route|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is rarely observed by humans, and the precise motivation for this phenomenon is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/12191469/Rare-footage-released-of-humpback-whale-hanging-tail-in-air-near-Hawaii.html|title=Rare footage released of humpback whale hanging tail in air near Hawaii|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that whales either undertake this activity to catch the wind and 'sail' through the water, or as a method to cool down. A third theory suggests that the whale is feeding close to the sea floor. 

Scientists believe that tail-sailing is fairly common amongst certain species, such as the [[Southern right whale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aol.com/article/2016/03/11/humpback-whale-tail-sails-as-she-watches-her-calf-off-maui-coast/21326396/|title=Humpback whale 'tail-sails' as she watches her calf off the Maui coast|last=Staff|first=AOL|website=AOL.com|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humpback whales are migratory and only eat during half the year.&lt;ref name=scholarworks&gt;http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1328&amp;context=etd_theses&lt;/ref&gt; They will typically spend the summer months (May through September) in feeding grounds with cooler waters that they return to every year.&lt;ref name=scholarworks /&gt; They have been documented feeding in areas such as Southeast Alaska and off the coast of Antarctica.&lt;ref name=scholarworks /&gt; During the other half of the year humpbacks will spend time in their breeding grounds where they do not eat at all. During their feeding season humpback whales will actively feed for up to twenty-two hours a day.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; They do this in order to have enough fat reserves stored in their bodies to live off of during their breeding season.&lt;ref name =Kraus /&gt;

==Method==
Bubble-net feeding is a cooperative feeding method used by groups of humpback whales. This behavior is not instinctual, it is learned.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; Not every population of humpbacks know how to bubble net feed according to some studies.&lt;ref name = Kraus /&gt; After observing different populations it is apparent which whales know how to create a bubble net and which do not.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; They have to learn the method in order to be successful. Humpback whales use vocalizations to communicate to one another in order to effectively and efficiently execute the bubble net in order for them all to feed.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; As the group circles a school of small fish such as [[salmon]], [[krill]], or [[herring]] they use a team effort to disorient and corral the fish into a net of bubbles.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; One whale will typically begin to exhale out of their blowhole beneath the surface at the school of fish to begin the process.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; More whales will also start to blow bubbles while continuing to circle their prey. They corral the fish into a tight circle while creating a net of bubbles to surround the fish and keep them from escaping.&lt;ref name= Kraus /&gt; The size of the net created can range from three to thirty meters in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;http://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/staff/pubs/PubPDFs/Pub2561.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One whale will sound a feeding call, at which point all whales simultaneously swim upwards with mouths open to feed on the trapped fish.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; As the whales swim up to the surface to feed they can hold up to 15,000 gallons of sea water as they use their [[baleen plates]] to strain the water to get the maximum amount of fish they need.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; Humpback whales have 14 to 35 throat grooves that run from the top of the chin all the way down to the navel.&lt;ref name=forwhales /&gt; These grooves allow the mouth to expand.&lt;ref name=forwhales /&gt; When they swallow they blow the sea water out from their blowhole as they ingest the fish.&lt;ref name=forwhales /&gt; The fish that they ingest are also a source of hydration for them.&lt;ref name=forwhales /&gt; Bubble netting is an advanced and necessary feeding method developed by humpback whales to feed multiple mouths at one time.

Humpback whales are solitary creatures and do not always feed in large groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1328&amp;context=etd_theses&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to perform a similar method of surface feeding but it is referred to as lunge feeding.&lt;ref&gt;http://encountersnorth.org/wildexplorer/humpbackwhale/natural-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is similarly executed as the whale dives down beneath a school of fish and rises to the surface with its mouth wide open. Once it reaches the surface it will swallow and separate the fish from the saltwater and exhales the excess water.

==Theories==
This method of feeding, which is uncommon and unique to humpback whales,&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; has sparked plenty of interest. There has been some speculation behind the net of bubbles and how fish are trapped within. One study suggests that it is the acoustics from the exhalations from the whales that traps the fish.&lt;ref name=soton&gt;http://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/staff/pubs/PubPDFs/Pub2561.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that within the circle it is silent but outside the sounds have such high intensity that it is nearly impossible for fish to escape.&lt;ref name=soton /&gt; The energy from these calls have measured up to 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name=soton /&gt;

There are also a multitude of theories behind why humpback whales use bubble netting as a feeding method. The earliest documentation of this feeding behavior was recorded in 1929 from the Norwegian Sea .&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; They speculated that it was playful behavior between the whales and a form of socializing. Change in environmental factors over the years has also been discussed as a possibility behind why this feeding method was created.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; The most popular theory behind bubble net feeding is one of survival. After being hunted to near extinction it is believed that humpback whales developed this method of feeding in order to feed as many whales as possible in a short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.02.110171.002101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Humpback whales have a vertical throat roughly the size of a grapefruit. They cannot physically swallow anything larger than that. They are carnivores and primarily feed on small fish such as krill, juvenile salmon, and herring.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1328&amp;context=etd_theses&lt;/ref&gt; They are also baleen whales, which means that they do not have teeth,&lt;ref&gt;http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/explore/humpback_whale.html&lt;/ref&gt; so they have to be able to eat things that they can swallow whole. They have several vertical grooves running down the length of their body so that they can hold large volumes of water and fish at one time.  They feed for up to twenty-two hours a day, taking in anywhere from 4,400-5,500 pounds of food per day.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1328&amp;context=etd_theses&lt;/ref&gt; The only time they feed is during the summer months and in the winter they live solely off of fat reserves they have stored away&lt;ref&gt;http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/explore/humpback_whale.html&lt;/ref&gt; They are not able to feed in warmer waters such as Hawaii or Mexico because there is no adequate habitat for the food that they live off of. The waters in Southeast Alaska, for example, are teeming with fish, making it a prime feeding ground for humpback whales during their feeding season.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1328&amp;context=etd_theses&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
Bubble net feeding does not occur everywhere. Alaska's cold waters and the high amounts of sun exposure in the summer time produce food for humpbacks. Areas such as Antarctica and the North Pacific are host to diverse marine ecosystems that provide adequate feeding opportunities for humpback whales.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juneauflukes.org/feeding.html&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast Alaska, for example, is home to coastal glaciers that provide plentiful nutrients for suitable fish habitats.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juneauflukes.org/feeding.html&lt;/ref&gt; Areas with warmer waters such as Mexico and Hawaii where whales go to breed do not provide attractive habitats for fish which is why humpback whales rely on their fat reserves they have from their feeding season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.juneauflukes.org/feeding.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecotourism==
Up until September 2016 humpback whales had been on the endangered species list since 1970 due to the massive whaling that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2169603/Humpback-whales-work-unison-bubble-net-fishing-corral-meal-Alaskan-coast.html&lt;/ref&gt; The population has recovered due to enforced restrictions on whaling and the promotion of ecotourism. Whale watching companies can profit from taking tourists out to sea so they may observe humpback whale behaviors in their natural habitat, which can help promote conservation. There are strict rules enforced by the Coast Guard to help keep vessels from disrupting the whales natural behavior. As a general rule, boats are not allowed to come within three hundred yards of marine mammals. If a marine mammal does approach a vessel, its engines are to be shut down immediately to prevent affecting the animal's behavior.
Bubble net feeding has become a key feature in the tourism industry. It is visually appealing and provides a good opportunity to learn about this species. Unfortunately it is also both a rare and unpredictable behavior. The nutrient rich waters that provide this feeding ground for the whales often does not have good visibility. The only indications of a bubble net occurring that can be sighted on the surface is a ring of bubbles coming up. It is also common to see birds flock to the area where the whales will feed hoping to catch the fish being brought to the surface.

While the population of humpback whales has been successful in making a come back, there have been some concerns with how tourism has been affecting the whales and their natural environment. By taking people out on the water to view these animals it can be disruptive and have a negative impact on their behavior. The increase in human to cetaceans contact has resulted in short term behavior changes, this includes feeding methods. Research is still being done, but one of the potential results from this increase in interactions is having to find food in other habitats. The amount of noise that is emitted from vessels is disruptive to communications between humpbacks and affects their ability to bubble net feed.

'''Ethelbert''' was a juvenile [[killer whale]] or Orca that surfaced in the [[Columbia River]] near [[Portland, Oregon]] in October 1931. The whale swam 100 miles from the sea up the river. Being a rare sighting that far up the river, many sportsmen grabbed rifles and guns and began to shoot the whale to try and kill it for themselves. The Governor [[Julius L. Meier]] ordered them to stop. Some thought the whale was healthy but others thought it was slowly dying and needed to be humanely [[animal euthanasia|put down]]. Ed Lessard, a former [[whaling|whaler]], and his son Joseph Lessard set out with [[harpoon]]s and killed the whale, who had gained the name Ethelbert.

The body of the whale was retrieved by others and pickled in [[embalming fluid]] for preservation. Ethelbert was seized by the [[State of Oregon]] and later, through many legal battles going all the way to the [[Supreme Court]], the whale was procured by Lessard. Some years after, Lessard carted Ethelbert around the country as a showpiece. After retiring the show, he brought the whale to his property on a mountain in [[Washougal]], WA where the whale still rests, resisting decay.
