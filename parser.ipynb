      "'''Dogs''' (''Canis lupus familiaris''), known in [[Classical Chinese]] as ''quan'' ({{zh|c=犬|p=quǎn|w=''ch'üan''}}), played an important role in ancient Chinese society.\n",

      "== Domestication ==\n",
      "\n",
      "An examination of the genetic evidence by Carles Vila and others confirms that the progenitor of the domestic dog is the wolf (''Canis lupus'').<ref>J. A. Leonard, R. K. Wayne, J. Wheeler, R. Valadez, S. Guillén, C Vilà, (2002) \"Ancient DNA evidence for Old World origin of New World dogs\" ''Science'' 298: 1613-1616.</ref> The suggested date of their domestication is about 100,000 [[Before Christ|BC]]. While accepting the wolf as the ancestor, paleontologists and archaeologists believe domestication came much later. A reconstruction by a joint team of researchers from China and Sweden postulates that humans may have domesticated dogs from wolves as recently as 15,000 years ago. They found that, while most dogs share a common gene pool, genetic diversity is highest in East Asia, suggesting dogs have been domesticated there the longest. Genetic research suggests that all domestic dogs worldwide may have originated from possibly three female [[wolf|wolves]].\n",
      "\n",
      "The dog, along with the pig, were the earliest animals domesticated in China. Remains of both animals have been found in the oldest [[Neolithic]] settlements of the [[Yangshao]] (circa 4000 BC) and [[Hemudu]] (circa 5000 BC) cultures. Canine remains similar to the [[Dingo]] have been found in some early graves excavated in northern China. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tests on neolithic dog bones show similarities between dogs from this era and modern-day Japanese dogs, especially the [[shiba inu]].<ref>Nobuo Shigehara, Qi Guoqin, Hajime Komiya, Yuan Jing, \"Morphological study of the ancient dogs from three neolithic sites in China\" ''International Journal of Osteoarchaeology'' Vol. 8 Issue 1 (2008) pp. 11-22.</ref>\n",

      "== Dogs as ceremonial sacrifice ==\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Bruno Schindler, the origin of using dogs as sacrificial animals dates back to a primitive cult in honour of a dog-shaped god of vegetation whose worship later became amalgamated with that of [[Shang Di]], the reigning deity of the Shang [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].\n",
      "\n",
      "Systematic excavation of Shang tombs around Anyang since 1928 have revealed a large number of animal and human [[sacrifices]]. There was hardly a tomb or a building consecrated without the sacrifice of a dog. At one site, Xiaotong, the bones of a total of 825 human victims, 15 horses, 10 oxen, 18 sheep and 35 dogs were unearthed. Dogs were usually buried wrapped in reed mats and sometimes in [[lacquer]] [[coffin]]s. Small bells with clappers, called ''ling'' (鈴) have sometimes been found attached to the necks of dogs or horses. The fact that alone among domestic animals dogs and horses were buried demonstrates the importance of these two animals to ancient Chinese society. It's reflected in an [[idiom]] passed down to modern times: \"to serve like a dog or a horse.\" (犬馬之勞).\n",
      "\n",
      "Shang oracle bones mention questions concerning the whereabouts of lost dogs. They also refer to the ''ning'' (寧) rite during which a dog was dismembered to placate the four winds or honour the four directions. This sacrifice was carried over into Zhou times. The ''Er ya'' records a custom to dismember a dog to \"bring the four winds to a halt.\" (止風). Other ceremonies involving dogs are mentioned in the ''Zhou li''. In the ''nan'' (難) sacrifice to drive away pestilience, a dog was dismembered and his remains buried in front of the main gates of the [[Capital (political)|capital]]. The ''ba'' (軷) sacrifice to ward off evil required the [[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]], riding in a jade chariot, to crush a dog under the wheels of his carriage. The character ''ba'' gives a clue as to how the ceremony took place. It is written with the radical for chariot (車) and a phonetic element which originally meant an animal whose legs had been bound (发). It was the duty of a specially appointed official to supply a dog of one colour and without blemishes for the sacrifice. The [[blood]] of dogs was used for the swearing of covenants between nobles. \n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the late fifth century BC, surrogates began to be used for sacrifice in lieu of real dogs. The ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' mentions the use of [[straw dog]]s as a metaphor:\n",
      "<poem>\n",
      "     Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures as straw dogs;\n",
      "     the sage is ruthless, and treats the people as straw dogs.<ref>In Chinese: 天地不仁 以萬物為芻狗 聖人不仁 以百姓為芻狗. Chen Guying ed. ''Laozi zhu yi ji ping jie'' 老子注譯及評介 (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1984) at 78. Incidentally the term \"straw dogs\" became the title of a book of philosophy by [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (''[[Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals]]'') and a [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|1971 film]].</ref>\n",
      "</poem>\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the practice of burying actual dogs by no means died out. One [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] royal mausoleum, for example, included two hunting dogs with gold and silver neck rings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later, clay figurines of dogs were buried in tombs. Large quantities of these sculptures have been unearthed from the [[Han dynasty]] onwards. Most show sickle-shaped tails not unlike the modern [[shiba inu]] or [[akita inu]].\n",
